At least in my field (cognitive psychology) the superstars can get prof positions straight out of the PhD, and most schools have reasonably high rates of granting tenure.  Good but not exceptional candidates can get tenured positions through persistance (it\\'s not easy, but tenure is a substantial reward).  (An aside: you can be fired [with cause] prior to being granted tenure, but it\\'s quite a perk to be guaranteed a *job for life* upon gaining tenure).  I\\'m sure this varies by discipline,region, and school, but Greenspun\\'s \"average trajectory for a *successful* scientist\" is a strawman.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] Many scientists *do* love what they do and the lifestyle associated with academe.  My grad school advisor spent far more time drinking coffee on the quad watching the undergrad girls go by than any banker I know.\\r\\n\\r\\n[3] This neglects the opportunity of scientists to leave the ivory tower and head to industry.  Many of my friends are now consultants, market researchers, data analysts, and user research leads.  These folks make very reasonable money (better than folks with BAs in the same discipline).  Advanced training in the sciences gives one skills that no undergrad major will offer (both technical skills and important experience in public speaking, writing, and leadership/mentorship).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been several posts about the silliness of going through grad school and the poor economic prospects of PhD grads.  There are risks involved, and there are *certainly* more lucrative ways to spend one\\'s effort.  However, a discipline you love, a carefully chosen program and advisor, and hard work can certainly lead to a enjoyable and successful career in science.

My wife says that plenty of her university classmates were in the position primarily because they didn't know what they wanted to do. That kind of thinking could lead to too many people and not enough jobs. However, there are plenty of unfilled teaching jobs in CA (where I live). So much so that many teachers are teaching on emergency credentials. Essentially they haven't completed their credential courses but the need is/was so dire that they were allowed to teach.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other thing that's interesting is how many teachers are women. At my wife's school there is only one male teacher and he's about to retire. I often think that teaching is so low paying because it's thought of as a female profession. The men that do join the ranks of teachers seem to move up into administration more rapidly while their female counterparts tend to remain in jobs with proximity to students. My wife genuinely enjoys being with the kids she teaches and has no desire to move into administration.

Это моя позиция - я считаю сообщения qrilka *не релевантными* данному топику (не плохими, не скучными, не банальными, а именно не *релевантными*). Кроме того, мне хотелось (естественно), чтобы на верх попали топики, относящиеся к теме распространения reddit - чтобы легче было увидеть новые идеи и соответственно их обсуждать.\\r\\n\\r\\nСвой выбор я также объяснил qrilka - хотя мог бы и промолчать.\\r\\n\\r\\nРазумеется (и к счастью), я не единственный пользователь данного сервиса - у других пользователей другие мнения, предпочтения и интересы, и они также могут их выражать (стрелочками / новыми сабмитами).

Поэтому, кроме разве что информации про то, насколько посты/комментарии интересны *этой* группе людей, другого содержания оценки и рейтинги не несут.

Did a link get the most interest during the past 10 minutes? Most click-throughs, most vote-ups? Then it's the hottest item! (Yes, I know the hot algorithm is more complicated than that). Even if the item falls off in interest quickly, it's still an excellent measure of relative quality, because it's essentially competing on a relatively even field... competing with the other new links only. The 'top' list is an uneven field... because they show up on the 'top' list, they get more people seeing them, and thus more votes, KEEPING them on the top list. But 'hot' only stays hot while it's on the 'new' and 'hot' lists. It gets a boost once it makes it to the 'hot' page, but it at least has an even chance with the other 'new' items to get to the 'hot' page.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo 'hot' is the best determiner for link quality, in my opinion, rather than absolute value. Absolute value is also a good determiner... but it's less INTERESTING. It's less fun, less unique. It's also harder to pick a cutoff value, because that cutoff will change over time... as reddit gets more popular, the same quality link will get a higher score as more people vote on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the hot list is rather absolute... either you made it to the top #5 or not.

Just think of all the money we would have to  manage drug use in the US if we ended all spending on the war on drugs and taxed recreational drug sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast argument:  Historically, prohibition has always started with ideas of creating a utopian society without social problems.

They aim at making things more DRY and eliminating workarounds that used to be more clumsy. So while the Rails API may gain a few methods, it will actually make the programmer's experience using Rails more consistent and streamlined.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beauty of a framework like rails is that you can use it without leveraging its full api - go ahead and write your stuff 'old skool' in 15 lines of code, and a few days later, you'll look over that code and you'll slash it down to a mere 3-4 lines using a rails method you've just discovered - it's a lot of fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nDHH said somewhere that Rails 1.0 should have been 2.0, because he doesn't see a lot of major additions any time soon. He's wisely pushed 'higher level' functionality (like login systems, etc.) into generators, plugins, engines, whatnot, to keep the framework uncluttered. Rails is walking the line between high level convenience and low level flexibility better than any other framework I've ever used.\""
