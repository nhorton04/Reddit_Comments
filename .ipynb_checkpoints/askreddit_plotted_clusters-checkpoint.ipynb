       " 'like all biological determinist research  suffers from a host of problems that render any conclusions based on it regarding the possible genetic basis of specific psychobehavioral traits unwarranted below i will discuss some of the problems i noticed based on a cursory review in no particular order   nbsp  first it is important to remember that there is no reliable scientific evidence that specific psychobehavioral traits in humans have particular consistent genetic underpinnings what the available evidence instead shows is that rather than biology these traits derive their specific features from sociocultural and politicaleconomic environmental factors according to the evidence biology merely serves as a general potentiator of psychology and lacks a specific deterministic or even influential role in this regard indeed virtually all psychological traits eg selfconcept emotions motivation memory perception sexuality exhibit culturallyspecific features   in line with this given that the author take an evolutionary perspective and hypothesizes that concealed mating evolved as the norm in humans p  which is to say that he assumes this norm is biologically determined his findings are dubious in  cultural psychologist carl ratner elucidates why biological determinist theoretical orientations in the social sciences such as evolutionary psychology are untenable  it takes thousands of generations for genetic changes to accumulate via a sufficient number of organisms outreproducing other organisms to produce a new morphology yet humans have produced only  generations since the founding of the roman empire this is not enough time for new morphology to genetically evolve and human behavioral change does not involve morphological changes in genes neurotransmitters or cortical structures which obviates genetic evolutions pertinence to human behavior at all naturalistic theories of human psychology such as evolutionary psychology are false p  bold and italics added  nbsp  second the study relies on surveys which are generally unreliable due to complications including the  and  in fact the author admits that since informants are often reluctant to discuss their sexual lives    sexual aspects are often poorly documented and that informants may not practise liberal sexual behaviours in the presence of anthropologists that come from cultures where such behaviours are strongly disapproved of while he states that sufficient ethnographic data on the privacy of legitimate mating were found p  he apparently fails to elaborate on the criteria that qualify this data as sufficient these limitations and weaknesses are clearly considerable and do not exactly inspire confidence in the authors findings   nbsp  third the author states that idespread human behaviours are strong candidates for evolutionary adaptations p  however this claim is misleading in order to consider whether specific psychobehavioral traits are biologically determined evolutionary adaptations it is insufficient that they be merely widespread they must also be universal this is because a biologically determined traits in species do not exhibit crosspopulation variability and b widespread historicallyspecific sociocultural and politicaleconomic factors can potentially account for widespread behaviors in humans even so just like correlation ≠ causation universal ≠ biological indeed correlational evidence such as that presented in this study lacks the power to establish causation as i explain    in order to determine whether some variable x causes another variable y y causes x some third variable z causes both x and y or the association between x and y is merely incidental experiments are necessary this is a basic principle of research  while this research may certainly suggest genetic underpinnings to this concealed mating norm it by no means confirms their existence that is it does not amount to reliable scientific evidence that such underpinnings actually exist   it is scientifically irresponsible to conclude a genetic basis to widespread or even universal psychobehavioral traits prior to investigating and ruling out possible environmental causes i explicate on this point  with regard to homosexuality but it equally applies to all other psychological traits psychosexual or otherwise   your main problem here is in conceiving behavior in abstract general terms this gives the impression of universality when there in fact may be none in  cultural psychologist carl ratner discusses why this is problematic    in contrast with physical abstractions which provide essential information about gravitation floatation waves and gases abstract psychological notions about thinking memory feeling and learning are rather barren psychological abstractions usefully indicate the general aspects of human activity—especially in contrast to animal behavior—however they never reveal its particularity and variety as clifford geertz  chap  argues generalities such as man thinks man is moral man enjoys beauty man has kinship systems man uses language people have a sense of time humans categorize information are neither false nor unimportant however they fail to disclose the richness of the concrete particular instances from which those generalities are derived p          what we know for certain is that specific concrete psychobehavioral traits exist so occams razor would select for this conception of traits as concrete in favor of the notion that traits falling under some abstract category are materially related in order to support this latter claim scientific investigation into the matter is necessary as ratner continues       we cannot assume a more general level of explanation until more specific levels have been systematically ruled out if specific sociotechnological factors can plausibly account for psychological phenomena it is unwarranted to postulate universal factors for example the trobriander islanders sophisticated logical inference can plausibly be explained by their complex system of property rights and legal negotiation if their logical reasoning is found to be comparable to modern americans which we must emphasize has not been proven the explanation would lie in comparable formal features of the two social systems—ie in their individualized form of property allocation and their legal system of arbitration the trobrianders legal system having been imposed during their colonial period by the british and australian governments psychological similarities between the two peoples should not be attributed to abstract universal social features unless the formal features can be shown to be insufficient explanations ibid p   the author while interestingly listing qualitative variations in concealment p  nevertheless relies on an abstract conception of this behavior and fails to systematically rule out possible environmental confounds this further testifies to the unreliability of his conclusions   nbsp  fourth the author compares human behavior to that of nonhuman animals however as i elaborate  such comparisons are fallacious specifically they are    we cannot make any reasonable conclusions about human behavior based on animal studies this is precisely what stimulated the httpsenwikipediaorgwikihumanisticpsychology which took issue with behaviorists reliance on animal studies as humanistic psychologists note behaviorists downplayed ignored or even outright denied unique aspects of human behavior such as our free will and desirecapacity for personal growth humans are the only species capable of abstract and symbolic cognition as well as the only one able to organize complex societies unlike in other animals specific human behaviors generally have sociocultural rather than biological origins aside from things like the diving and suckling reflexes humans do not have instincts so to draw conclusions about human behavior based on studies of species that are largely instinctual would be whats called overextrapolation',\n",
