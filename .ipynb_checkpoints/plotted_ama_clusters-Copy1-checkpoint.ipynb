encounter and also happy birthday wish you the bestwierdest encounter as in with a patient id need you to a be a bit more specific because ive seenheardobservered so much stuff throughout the years 😅 and that award was for being on the front line salutethanks kind stranger much appreciated 😌👍 happy birthday however tell us about the most karen patient you had to transportoh man i might have to come back to this one because somthing you need to learn right off the bat is to  have thick skin meeting people for the first time at a hospital is not ideal so if they give you attitude you wouldnt know if they were told  minutes ago by a doc that they have aggressive cancer as an example so many times you let shit slide  buuuuuuuuutttt the number of people ive brought up from the er to thier rooms because they are staying a night or more and they are unhappy because a the room is too small some are somewhat small or b there is not a nice view out the window  and only once have i had a patient absolutely not want to stay in a particular room that they signed a paper stating they are refusing medical treatment and they left eyup because of a room what a waste of time and resources precovid  ive got the same birthday as you happy birthdaywoop woop happy birthday ♌ 🥳🥳🥳 hows the bitcoin coming along ur  have you ever encountered someone with schizophrenia ps happy birthdayas far as i know negative unless its been written in thier charts but i dont think im allowed to fully read it i dont bother besides finding thier mrndobname 🤔 its my birthday today  but its coming to a close different time zones do you think youll have cake do you even like cake i didnt but i bought some goodies to share with my workmates tomorrowhappy birthday 🥳🎂🎂🎂🎂 uuhh hell yeah i will ice cream cake cookies and cream my fave i do hate fruits onin cakes lol they just dont go well together fight me lol you are a blessing for doing that i sure hope you had a wonderful day 😌🍻if you  drop your wishlist sensei wishlist  this covid shit would go away  to go to a fucking rave its my escape from life lol  fly to central america and see the fam  fly to space imagine how much of a mind fuck that would be hell yeah  sky dive  go to la vita barcongra room those clubs are my favorite and they are always a good time 😂 lacusc medical if i had to guess happy birthday   when transporting face shield and mask or just mask also gloves or no  negative but even if you guessed right i wouldnt say youre right lol  thank you much appreciated 👍  we are required to wear a mask at all time inside the hospital so theres that and i bought my own face shield so i wear them most of the time especially when in the er or if a patient has a breathing vent is intubated which we would also wear an  mask ass well  thats a tough one because the biggest thing you want to do is avoid any cross contamination and since i also move covid patients that something you really want to avoid  with that said some health guides and what we have been taught regarding ppe has changed once covid started i wont get into full details cause every once in a while it changes again and i dont want to give miss information regarding how we usedispose of said ppe  most of the timenow at least i do use gloves the entire time i transport but when i have to press buttonsuse my badge to access doors i use the backside of my gloved handthe nonleast contaminated side or my watch to get a hold of my badge or press say the elevator button this lowers the risk of spreading anything im sure i missed some stuff but im trying to get to eveylry question now if you have more ask away  my birthday is the  too how well does the job paywhen i started basepay was  ish morning and weekdays working mids and nights pays even more and working weekends adds to that  with my  years and usually working weekends im at around  ish now no hazard pay though  human logistics you poor bastard i thought being a courier was bad enough only live thing i transported was baby chickens to a teen ager for experiments so that was weird  i did move containers back and forth between hospitals and ivf facilities those folk have all the worst jokes i didnt even get a chance to make any of my ownhuman what lol honestly i love my job i get to see the ins and outs of a hospital ive seen some gnarly shit go down and the friends ive made are friends forever wouldnt change it until i get my xrayct license 😈  aaahhh shit to a teen yeaaaahhhh 😂😂  lmao in a place full of disease and sadness sometimes a bad joke to break the stress is just what you need 👍 lol but you gotta be quicker  exactly how patient are you  and thank you and happy birthdayhow patient am i  i watch youtube videos without skipping the ads  in all seriousness if you are going to deal with patients you need very thick skin so far not a single patient has gotten remotely close to getting any kind of attitude from me its been almost  years working  happy birthday man and also thanks for ur service my question is what was the age of the oldest patient u transported and how was himherthank you kind friend 😊  ooooooohhhhhh i would say somewhere around  nothing particularly interesting about that patient tbh just kind of there hate to say it but on their last moments imo  ive had many  year old who walk and talk as if they are still young hell just last week i admitted a  year old and this guy practically ran from the gurney into his bed 😂 i joked and said not to run away he replied with  i wouldnt want to embarrass security lmfao thats how i wanna be when im old 😂😭 happy birthday i am a nurse and we really appreciate you and your friendliness with the patients and your hard workand thank all you nurses for literally fighting this tough fight  i hope you are safe and stay safe during these times nurse and i wish safety for you and your colleagues 👏👏  personally i wouldnt be able to do what yall are doing i feel like i would get too attached to my patients and having to bag someone i got attached to is the biggest no no for me 😬 why cant u celebrate itbecause covid said fuck  and dodger stadium is closed where i wouldve been tonight behind home plate double fisting tall cans all night while enjoying dodger dogs 🤤🤤🤤  happy birthday  thank you for your work dont mention it i love what i do and it brings me joy
