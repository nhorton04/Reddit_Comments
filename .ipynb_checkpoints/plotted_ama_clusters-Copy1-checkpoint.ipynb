might have to come back to this one because somthing you need to learn right off the bat is to  have thick skin meeting people for the first time at a hospital is not ideal so if they give you attitude you wouldnt know if they were told  minutes ago by a doc that they have aggressive cancer as an example so many times you let shit slide  buuuuuuuuutttt the number of people ive brought up from the er to thier rooms because they are staying a night or more and they are unhappy because a the room is too small some are somewhat small or b there is not a nice view out the window  and only once have i had a patient absolutely not want to stay in a particular room that they signed a paper stating they are refusing medical treatment and they left eyup because of a room what a waste of

i had to guess happy birthday   when transporting face shield and mask or just mask also gloves or no  negative but even if you guessed right i wouldnt say youre right lol  thank you much appreciated üëç  we are required to wear a mask at all time inside the hospital so theres that and i bought my own face shield so i wear them most of the time especially when in the er or if a patient has a breathing vent is intubated which we would also wear an  mask ass well  thats a tough one because the biggest thing you want to do is avoid any cross contamination and since i also move covid patients that something you really want to avoid  with that said some health guides and what we have been taught regarding ppe has changed once covid started i wont get into full details cause every once in a while it changes again and i dont want to give miss information regarding how we usedispose of said ppe  most of the timenow at least i do use gloves the entire time i transport but when i have to press buttonsuse my badge to access doors i use the backside of my gloved handthe nonleast contaminated side or my watch to get a hold of my badge or press say the elevator button this lowers the risk of spreading anything im sure i missed some stuff but im trying to get to eveylry question now if you have more ask away  my birthday is the  too how well does the job paywhen i started basepay was  ish morning and weekdays working mids and nights pays even more and working weekends adds to that  with my  years and usually working weekends im at around  ish now no hazard pay though  human logistics you poor bastard i thought being a courier was bad enough only live thing i transported was baby chickens to a teen ager for experiments so that was weird  i did move containers back and forth between hospitals and ivf facilities those folk have all the worst jokes i didnt even get a chance to make any of my ownhuman what lol honestly i love my job i get to see the ins and outs of a

full of disease and sadness sometimes a bad joke to break the stress is just what you need üëç lol but you gotta be quicker  exactly how patient are you  and thank you and happy birthdayhow patient
