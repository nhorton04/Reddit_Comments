dreams eventually it became all i ever dreamed about it was wonderful at first every night i would go to sleep hoping i could have the kind of freedom i could never have while awake but eventually my mind started to catch on  i would go to sleep and dream of flying then i would realize it was a dream and immediately wake up my waking hours were spent exhausted from lack of sleep after that started happening dream flight wake exhaustion dream flight wake exhaustion nearly every night that is until my mind started to become clever about these things instead of flying just flying it found ways to justify what i was experiencing it wasnt flight it was some kind of magic that allowed me to move through the air it wasnt flight it was a special bicycle that i could ride through the sky it wasnt flight it was swimming up gliding down anything i could use to trick myself into staying asleep longer anything i could use to keep myself from realizing i was in a dream  eventually my mind caught on to that too dream flight wake exhaustion dream flight wake exhaustion  i wonder what changed if it was because i was so physically tired that my body was forced into sleep regardless or if it was because somehow throughout all of this my mind was still trying to come up with some other ways to rationalize myself into remaining asleep but ill never forget the first night it happened the same pattern started i fell asleep started dreaming found myself in flight realized i was dreaming anddidnt wake up i almost did i could feel myself waking up that same jolt of realization that would typically leave me hyperventilating as i shot up in bed disappointed and unable to sleep for the rest of the night but this time i stayed asleep and i could still fly  things became more interesting after that i still dreamed of flying every night but as soon as it happened i would become lucid and could spend the rest of the dream in complete control well not always complete control as i became older i started dreaming of other things i experienced different types of lucid dreams the scale i usually use is awarenesscontrol lucidity isnt an on or off thing you see you can have a high controllow awareness dream where youre able to manipulate people and environments but you feel like a puppeteer in an empty world you never fully realize youre dreaming or you can have a high awarenesslow control dream where youre fully aware that youre in a dream but theres nothing you can do to change anything  sometimes its somewhere in the middle and those are always the dreams i find most interesting although theyre also the dreams that are typically the most frightening you see without full awareness or full control things can getweird   one of my favorite nightmares started normally at first but somewhere along the line i realized i was trapped inside a simulation along with the friends who were with me it didnt frighten me at first until i realized i couldnt escape i tried i would try to find glitches that i could exploit walls overlapping ceilings at unnatural angles a flower vase hovering over a table people clipping into floors but every time i thought i was free i would be met with another glitch and realize the true nature of my situation i always ended back where i started until finally some other force caught on that i was previously unaware of the true controller it was merely curious at first until it understood what i was attempting then there was anger it realized what i was doing and always stopped me it would tempt me and taunt me it would introduce glitches areas that i thought were outside of its omniscience something i could take advantage of but they were always traps and the more i struggled and fought the more it learned   i realized that something greater would be needed to defeat it the combined power of all human minds inside the simulation resisting at once overloading its control and breaking its illusion so we gathered and we fought every single one of us against what and how i dont quite know dream logic doesnt always make sense and then at the nearclimax of this great battle snap back to the beginning but different this time i called out to my friends what happened to us what happened to this world i was greeted by an empty shell it was like talking to an npc empty shells everyone all smiles and canned responses no memory no agency no mind and i realized i was alone entirely alone  the controller had fun with me after that i still tried to escape on my own but it had learned all my tricks it was angry before but it was laughing now it would introduce novel glitchesi still had hope at firstbut they would only serve to drive me into a deeper layer of the simulation i thought the glitches would be my escape and it mocked me for this now i couldnt escape the glitches until there was nothing but glitches all of reality breaking down around me until my body and mind were torn layer through layer the only thoughts and emotions remaining nothing but the purest panic  and then i woke up apparently i had worked myself up so much in the dream that it forced me awake and then i knew the true reality of the situation i could never escape the simulation because the dream was the simulation freedom could only come through waking up and leaving the simulationthe dreamentirely  i call these mixed awarenesscontrol dreams enough to know that something is off somehow and enough to have some degree of control over such an unnatural situation   theyre my favorite kind of lucid dream  ive been sleeping a lot recently its hard to get out of bed most daysthings have been hard recentlyand leaving this hopeless world for one of infinite possibilities is a temptation ive found less and less reason to resist ive had all kinds of lucid dreams but theyve always been our own i think   i wonder what other kinds of lucid dreams there are i wonder whos dream i could find myself in  this mor
