       "'Tldr: do whatever the fuck you want. So you\\'re telling me people on the internet LIE???? [removed] This is so funny this subreddit got fucked by one person A note about celebrity request bans: when /r/iama (that\\'s the bigger sub) had its peak wave of popularity about ten years ago, that sub, and therefore this sub, was *full* of requests for AMAs.  They took up about half of all the submissions.  No one ever requests people at all anymore-celebs or otherwise--so that rule may seem a bit out of place.  But before you would just scroll down this page and see a bunch of requests for will smith, lady gaga, the queen of england, etc, which was annoying because at the time it had like 20K people total.\\n\\nFeel free to request classes of people to post AMAs though; I\\'m not sure why that disappeared. Do you like cantaloupe? What does AMA stand for :( I liked that guy... He seemed like a really nice person Hmmm ok thnx for clarifying all that, but one quick q, did cancer kid get like verified or anything before he posted? So basically r/AMA is a shitty knockoff of r/ima meant for telling your fake stories or just shit posting. Nice Bbbbbb In other words, common sense (this seems to be rare nowadays, sadly) is the rule for posting and commenting. I\\'m good with that. [deleted] Happy cake day Heh, a decent human Wtf is AMA? Mpp Question: what does AMA stand for? Or mean I’m the producer and co host of the We Talked About This Podcast. Happy to answer any questions on how to start a podcast, advice on editing or producing the podcast.  Just ask away! what’s is ama? I’m learning how to do this for the first time with a throwaway :) So what ever happened with \"Coma girl\"? She turn up fake? Why can’t I post [removed] No, be a decent human and then do whatever you want Cant stop a Karen from believing crap.\\n\\nCant stop goose kids from being kids Ask me anything. I honestly can’t tell if you’re joking No, he lied.  So he definitely didn\\'t verify. When I first took over this subreddit, I had meant to simply link it to /r/iama since people confused the two.  I kept /r/ama up because I didn\\'t want to effectively delete all those AMAs.\\n\\n/r/ama is meant to be an alternative to /r/iama that\\'s less strict, and where you don\\'t have to be an interesting person necessarily.  If someone is definitely lying, we\\'ll ban them.  But the risk you have by coming here is that perhaps some people lie, just like anyone can lie to you anywhere online.  I could be lying about how I wanted to initially just link this sub to /r/iama.  \\n\\nYou just have to accept it for what it is.

Here is the gist. \\n\\nPretty much anything involved with the safe handling and transportation of our patients (plus some non-payment jobs). So I\\'ll bring patients from the\\nE.R to thier room (admitted patients).\\nTransferring them from room to room (including the ICU) \\nwhen they are being discharged. \\nSometimes bring them to imaging (x-ray, CT, ultrasound, VQ scans.)\\nEven patients coming from a helicopter too, I\\'ve been up to the helipad a handful of times it\\'s a great view!\\n\\n****** YES I MOVE DECEASED PATIENTS TO THE MORGUE, AND YES I HAVE TO OPEN UP THE BODY BAG TO Verify ITS THE CORRECT PATIENT, NO NOT BABIES*** I’ve got the same birthday as you, happy birthday. Happy birthday, however, tell us about the most Karen patient you had to transport? Also I should\\'ve been clear I meant to say I can\\'t celebrate how I WANTED to which was being at Dodger stadium behind home plate double fisting tall cans all night and eating dodger dogs. 😂 And ending the night with conga room or la cita bar lol Happy birthday! I am a nurse! And we really appreciate you and your friendliness with the patients and your hard work! And that award was for being on the front line. Salute. It\\'s my birthday today too(Aug11), but it\\'s coming to a close. (Different Time zones)\\nDo you think you\\'ll have cake? \\nDo you even like cake? \\nI didnt, but I bought some goodies to share with my workmates tomorrow. Drop your wishlist sensei ! Have you ever encountered someone with schizophrenia? ps Happy Birthday LAC+USC Medical if i had to guess. Happy Birthday!  \\n\\n\\nWhen transporting, face shield and mask or just mask? also gloves or no gloves? My birthday is the 11th too! How well does the job pay? happy birthday man (and also thanks for ur service). My question is: what was the age of the oldest patient u transported? and how was him/her? Happy birthday ! Thank you for your work :) Exactly how patient are you?\\n\\n(And thank you and happy birthday!) Happy birthday Happy birthday and thank you for being there, helping. First line workers are too often underappreciated . Human Logistics? You poor bastard. I thought being a courier was bad enough. Only live thing I transported was baby chickens, to a teen ager. For experiments. So that was weird.\\n\\nI did move containers back and forth between hospitals and IVF facilities.

I\\'d need you to a be a bit more specific, because I\\'ve seen/heard/observered so much stuff throughout the years 😅|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7myhe/im_a_patient_transporter_for_a_big_hospital_in_la/g12uneg/)\\nAnd that award was for being on the front line.

Because somthing you need to learn right off the bat is to 1. Have THICK skin, meeting people for the first time at a hospital is NOT ideal so if they give you attitude you wouldn\\'t know if they were told 5 minutes ago by a doc that they have aggressive cancer (as an example). So many times you let shit slide.  BUUUUUUUUUTTTT the number of people I\\'ve brought up from the E.R to thier rooms (because they are staying a night or more) and they are unhappy because A. The room is too small (some are somewhat small) Or B. There IS NOT a nice view out the window.  And only once have I had a patient absolutely NOT want to stay in a particular room that they signed a paper stating they are refusing medical treatment and they left.... Eyup because of a room. what a waste of time and resources.

I didnt, but I bought some goodies to share with my workmates tomorrow.|Happy birthday 🥳🎂🎂🎂🎂 Uuhh HELL YEAH I WILL! ice cream cake (cookies and cream my fave!) I do hate fruits on/in cakes lol they just don\\'t go well together fight me! Lol. You are a blessing for doing that I sure hope you had a wonderful day 😌🍻(if you drink)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7myhe/im_a_patient_transporter_for_a_big_hospital_in_la/g131248/)\\nDrop your wishlist sensei !|Wishlist? 1. This Covid shit would go away. 2. TO GO TO A FUCKING RAVE!!!!!!! (It\\'s my escape from life lol) 3. FLY TO central America and see the fam 4. Fly to space (imagine how much of a mind fuck that would be hell yeah!) 5. Sky dive 6. Go to la Vita bar/congra room those clubs are my favorite and they are always a good time 😂|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7myhe/im_a_patient_transporter_for_a_big_hospital_in_la/g131fk1/)\\nLAC+USC Medical if i had to guess. Happy Birthday!   When transporting, face shield and mask or just mask? also gloves or no gloves?|1. Negative (but even if you guessed right I wouldn\\'t say you\\'re right lol) 2. Thank you much appreciated 👍 3. We are required to wear a mask at all time inside the hospital, so there\\'s that and I bought my own face shield so I wear them most of the time (especially when in the E.R, or if a patient has a breathing vent/ is intubated, which we would also wear an N-95 mask ass well) 3. That\\'s a tough one because the biggest thing you want to do is avoid any cross contamination. (And since I also move covid PATIENTS that something you REALLY want to avoid) 4. With that said some health guides and what we have been taught regarding PPE, has changed once Covid started. I won\\'t get into full details cause every once in a while it changes again and I don\\'t want to give miss information regarding how we use/dispose of said PPE. 5. Most of the time(now at least) I do use gloves the entire time I transport, BUT when I have to press buttons/use my badge to access doors, I use the backside of my gloved hand(the non/least contaminated side, or my watch to get a hold of my badge or press say the elevator button) this lowers the risk of spreading anything..... I\\'m sure I missed some stuff but I\\'m trying to get to eveylry question now if you have more ask away :)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7myhe/im_a_patient_transporter_for_a_big_hospital_in_la/g136c1x/)\\nMy birthday is the 11th too!

Have a great day! 🎈 You ever take your work home with you? Today is my sons 3rd birthday. Happy birthday bro! You have any plans? Happy Birthday and stay safe!! It sucks that you can’t celebrate now but my advice is to plan a big Zoom meeting with all your family for a day you’re free. (With my Spanish-speaking family we’ve been calling them Zoompleaños) It’s my birthday too! There was a huge storm in my state and now all the power is out so I can’t really celebrate either. \\nHappy birthday!! No question.... Just wanted to give you a birthday shout-out from one birthday person to another!!😊 Having worked in medicine I want to say thank you for your work.  Patients and staff don\\'t appreciate the work transporters do.  You guys can make or break our schedule, and can really set the mood of the patient coming to us. Happy birthday!

So with all the bad shit you\\'ve seen, are you more grateful for what you have in your life and the people in it? Or does everything suck? Happy birthday Happy mutual cake day! \\nHow old are you turning? When was the last time you properly celebrated it? If you’re a patient transporter do you mostly take people who are close to death and need more support from a different hospital or are you taking release patients to rehab centers because they have gotten better. How’s your birthday going so far? Happy birthday day A bit late; but have you ever delt with suicide/suicidal patient? but he\\'s staying on the scaffold about 40-ft up off the ground and he was cutting a beam above him not level but straight up and down vertically and when he got through cutting he just rested the saw on his right leg and when he rested it up against his tool bag the blade grabbed his leg he been doing it for about 25-30 years at this point I don\\'t know what made him do it but then again we all have those days I have those days or I do dumb ass shit for no reason I don\\'t know what makes us do it just being humans I guess A lot of times on them jobs you don\\'t have any workers insurance and when you get hurt and you might get fired but he\\'d been working with us 10 15 years at this point I don\\'t know why he\\'d think we\\'d get on to him but whenever he done it I told him to come on down off the scaffold and I\\'ll take him right then I was the formen the job it\\'s just a mixture of that and him not wanting to look like a pussy in front of everybody else Yo birthday twins!!!! And it happens yeah I\\'ve never done it because I\\'m more careful than that knock on wood but give anything enough time it\\'ll happen he made a full recovery and is back to working 6 days a week with us happy irl cake day Happy Birthday!!\\n\\nFor you,\\n🍕\\n🍔\\n🎂\\n🍀\\n🎁\\n🎉 Ha\\'oli la hanau!! From Kauai Happy Birthday! How are you holding up with Covid?  Am I correct to assume your hospital has a lot of Covid patients? ,dwR [deleted] Credit card information? Phone number? Mother’s maiden name? I’m just kidding. What is your favourite type of cheese? To all the kind people that gave me rewards thank you very much I wasn\\'t expecting that, I\\'m pretty sure I responded to everyone and we had fun conversations too stay safe out there everyone and thanks for the birthday wishes 😌🍻 I know a guy was cutting a beam and had the skillsaw still going and stuck it to his leg he got a 9 inch gash he tied a price of shirt around the top of it worked till we took lunch (20 or 30 min) he sat down and said hey man you gotta take me to the hospital and I did 🤣 Happy Birthday, CUNTWAD Wierdest encounter? As in with a patient? I\\'d need you to a be a bit more specific, because I\\'ve seen/heard/observered so much stuff throughout the years 😅 That caught me off guard 😅 thanks for the reward kind stranger. Y\\'all are very welcome I genuinely enjoy what I do 👍 I’ve been stuck in hospital wayyy too much in my life and you guys are fuckin awesome and under appreciated Woop woop happy birthday ♌ 🥳🥳🥳 how\\'s the Bitcoin coming along (ur username) Mine too birthday gang August 11th gang best gang. Oh man I might have to come back to this one. Because somthing you need to learn right off the bat is to \\n1. Have THICK skin, meeting people for the first time at a hospital is NOT ideal so if they give you attitude you wouldn\\'t know if they were told 5 minutes ago by a doc that they have aggressive cancer (as an example). So many times you let shit slide.\\n\\nBUUUUUUUUUTTTT the number of people I\\'ve brought up from the E.R to thier rooms (because they are staying a night or more) and they are unhappy because \\nA. The room is too small (some are somewhat small) \\nOr \\nB. There IS NOT a nice view out the window. \\n\\nAnd only once have I had a patient absolutely NOT want to stay in a particular room that they signed a paper stating they are refusing medical treatment and they left.... Eyup because of a room. what a waste of time and resources. (Pre-covid times) And thank all you nurses for literally fighting this tough fight!!\\n\\nI hope you are safe and stay safe during these times nurse. And I wish safety for you and your colleagues 👏👏\\n\\n personally I wouldn\\'t be able to do what y\\'all are doing I feel like I would get too attached to my patients and having to bag someone I got attached to is the biggest no no for me 😬 Thanks kind stranger, much appreciated! \\n😌👍 Happy birthday 🥳🎂🎂🎂🎂\\nUuhh HELL YEAH I WILL! ice cream cake (cookies and cream my fave!) \\nI do hate fruits on/in cakes lol they just don\\'t go well together fight me! Lol. \\nYou are a blessing for doing that I sure hope you had a wonderful day 😌🍻(if you drink) Wishlist?\\n1. This Covid shit would go away.\\n2. TO GO TO A FUCKING RAVE!!!!!!! (It\\'s my escape from life lol) \\n3. FLY TO central America and see the fam\\n4. Fly to space (imagine how much of a mind fuck that would be hell yeah!)\\n5. Sky dive \\n6. Go to la Vita bar/congra room those clubs are my favorite and they are always a good time 😂 As far as I know, negative unless it\\'s been written in thier charts but I don\\'t think I\\'m allowed to fully read it (I don\\'t bother besides finding thier MRN/DOB/name) 🤔 1. Negative (but even if you guessed right I wouldn\\'t say you\\'re right lol)\\n2. Thank you much appreciated 👍\\n3. We are required to wear a mask at all time inside the hospital, so there\\'s that and I bought my own face shield so I wear them most of the time (especially when in the E.R, or if a patient has a breathing vent/ is intubated, which we would also wear an N-95 mask ass well) \\n3. That\\'s a tough one because the biggest thing you want to do is avoid any cross contamination. (And since I also move covid PATIENTS that something you REALLY want to avoid) \\n4. With that said some health guides and what we have been taught regarding PPE, has changed once Covid started. I won\\'t get into full details cause every once in a while it changes again and I don\\'t want to give miss information regarding how we use/dispose of said PPE. \\n5. Most of the time(now at least) I do use gloves the entire time I transport, BUT when I have to press buttons/use my badge to access doors, I use the backside of my gloved hand(the non/least contaminated side, or my watch to get a hold of my badge or press say the elevator button) this lowers the risk of spreading anything..... \\nI\\'m sure I missed some stuff but I\\'m trying to get to eveylry question now if you have more ask away :) When I started basepay was 16/17 ish (morning and weekdays) working mids, and nights pays even more and working weekends ADDS to that. \\n\\nWith my 3 years and usually working weekends I\\'m at around 22 ish now..... No hazard pay though WOOPIE.... Thank you kind friend!! 😊\\n\\nOoooooohhhhhh I would say somewhere around 100/101 nothing particularly interesting about that patient tbh....

Because covid said FUCK 2020 and dodger stadium is closed where I would\\'ve been tonight behind home plate double fisting tall cans all night while enjoying dodger dogs 🤤🤤🤤 lol I guess I should\\'ve been more specific \"celebrate it how I wanted to\" 😅 Yes I just move patients in a hospital, I have 0 medical schooling (all we need is a BLS card, no further licenses and degrees) but I\\'d have to take a VERY educated guess and say YESS it definitely is hard. \\n\\nHonestly if I were to be anything nursing, doc, etc. I think it would be an anesthesiologist!!! Being able to be in the O.R and seeing everything go down BUT not having to do the very messy stuff seems very intriguing (but that\\'s just my guess of what they do lol) Happy birthday zakulon I wish you a very happy day in these tough times friend keep your head up high and do things you enjoy today. Best wishes! Ooooooooffffff uuuuuuhhhhh \\nGriffin..... Yeah Griffin!!! Thanks kind stranger!!!\\nif I may ask what part of the world? Woop woop happy birth day to you too Erialll!!!\\nHere\\'s to us Leo\\'s and I hope you have a good one too friend 🍻 This one is a tough one because you meet all sorts of people on a daily basis that you tend to forget even the very good/bad patients\\n\\nBut one  can foundly remember was of an older gentleman in his late 80\\'s or so, who had the most uplifting spirit I\\'ve ever seen. I was transferring him from an overflow area to his new room, and he would crack jokes every couple seconds that really made me laugh, and he sang the last couple minutes as we where getting him situated in his new room. And he was flirting with the female nurses (in a respectable manner in my opinion, plus the nurses were getting a kick too lo) \\n\\nIt was funny and wholesome I hope that guy is well in life. Such a calm and fun soul :\\') Yeeeaaahh happy birthday to the lioness!!! And 21 too I\\'ll cheers to that!!! CHEERS!!!\\n\\nYeah I have something planned with a few friends for dinner. I should\\'ve been more clear on my tittle.\\nI meant I can\\'t celebrate how I WANTED TO, which was being behind home plate with a beer in each hand at Dodger stadium lol.\\n\\nAww man you didn\\'t have to do that much appreciated fhalfpap!!! I hope you and the fam have a great day and tell your daughter I said \"happy birthday, birthday twin 🥳\" LOL 25 years young my friend 👍 If I can remember to recheck my comments I\\'ll come back and say happy birthday Buliteup but in case I don\\'t happy early birthday friend, here\\'s to us celebrating a lack luster birthday lol CHEERS!!! Happy birthday to us! HIP HIP HORAAY!!! \\n\\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY to you too shadowcatamount cheers friend! Have a fun day!! I should\\'ve been a little more clear on my post, I\\'m still doing something small with a select few of friends.\\n However what I REALLY wanted to do was be at Dodger stadium behind home plate with a tall can beer in each hand eating dodger dogs while enjoying a beautiful baseball game at the ravine! \\n\\nBut thanks for the birthday wishes and questions n UltimateButtToucher...... Hahahahah love the name lol have a good one friend :) My favorite band would have to be All That Remains ( finally got to see them live for the first time last year it was a BLAST!! And first ever concert I went to as well .... And I went solo.... AND I caught a drumstick from the opening bands drummer all in all fucking GREAT and memorable night!)\\n\\nNext up would have to be Lamb of God. If there is ever a moment I need to get pumped up LoG had me covered! \\n\\nWhat about yours? I\\'d love to hear it:) I spent the first ~5 hours responding to questions, and I\\'m having a blast responding to everyone so yeah I\\'m have a fun day so far thanks for asking. \\n\\nI hope you are well too :) LMFAO!!!!! Believe me that feeling gets worse and worse and I\\'m only 25. Enjoy those years you\\'re only in your teens once. \\n\\nFyi I don\\'t think they are open because of covid but please don\\'t go to a strip club to celebrate it\\'s a waste of money. \\n\\nLike Jay-Z said \\n\\n\"Wanna know what\\'s more important than throwing away money at a strip club?..... CREDIT\" \\n\\nHAVE blessed day friend and be safe out there cheers! :) I knew there was a few comments I would get back to! \\nSorry for the late response but I think I responded to another redditor on this.\\n\\nAnyway the most awkward one was when I was transferring a patient from to a new room and this dude kept hitting on every female nurse we would pass(pretty rudely too) and caressed 2 Doctors hair as we passed them (I was pushing an I.V pole and and the bed so my hands were full) it was so awkward and I kept saying sorry to everyone and kept telling the guy to stop but he didn\\'t... That\\'s been the most awkward one sorry to those nurses and doctors.... Thanks friend much appreciated I\\'ll be with some friends for a house dinner later tonight :\\') Negative never though if someone did that would be illegal bringing a patient home with you hmmmmm lmao.... But there have some some good and bad moments that come back with me. Some haunt me to this day and some cheer me up so there\\'s that. Happy birthday to your lil lion cub Krampus1313 ( btw have you head the book Krampus: the tile lord? By Gerald Brom? I don\\'t read much but that book was fun and got me more into reading!!)\\n\\nBday dinner with a select few friends at a friend\\'s house, although I REALLY wanted to be at Dodger stadium behind home plate with  a tall can beer in each hand enjoying the game. Sigh maybe next year! Lmao I love that zoompleaños!!! I gotta let my family know but many of my Tia\\'s and tios arent good with tech so I doubt it would be THAT successful. Also it helps that most of my closest friends/cousins work in the same hospital as me SO it\\'s not as bad if we see each other since we work in the same place. But we still try and keep it at a minimum.\\n\\nThanks for the comment Bones4Breakfast..... Suspect user name.... Hmmmmmm all my bones check out. I\\'m watching you!! Would this happen to be Indiana by any chance?? (You don\\'t have to answer that if you don\\'t want to) I think I was talking to a friend in the past hours talking about a storm.... Or something. \\n\\nAnyway I hope all that clears up soon and you get power back up friend stay positive and you\\'ll be able to celebrate soon enough! Thanks for the comment notjustrocks :) HAPPY BIRTHDAY 88irockclimb cheers To us mate! 🍻😊\\n\\nQuestion for you what\\'s been the scariest moment rock climbing (assuming by username of course lol) Thanks friend I appreciate that very much!!. \\n\\nAnd I appreciate everything you medical workers so too y\\'all the MVP\\'s\\n\\nI will say sometimes a patient and thier nurse just never got along.well when I\\'m discharging/transferring them I play devil\\'s advocate and just side with the patient (even when they are in the wrong per the nurse) because I\\'ll only be seeing them for a few minutes anyway, so if this can change thier mood for the next nurse or person they interact with then so be it. In the end everyone is happy. Thanks HangryHufflepuff1!!!!\\nBut it\\'s all about Slytherin!!!! >:) Happy early birthday to you lion friend! Cheers to us! I hope you have a good day manana friend! :) 🍻 Happy birthday to us captanbug 😂hahaha cheers 🍻\\n\\nUuuhhh in the beginning it was kind of stressful cause it was a new environment and what not and you don\\'t want be in peoples way/interrupt etc. But now (after almost 3 years) it\\'s like whatever. Sometimes you have to get in nurses/docs case because they are taking way too long and are delaying patient care. Which in my opinion is always fun lol THANKFULLY no patient I have moved has coded and thus needed to do CPR (knock on wood) the day that happens.... fuck idk that\\'s my biggest stress I guess. \\n\\nEven in the E.R where it\\'s the most hectic you learn to stay calm and collected. I hope this answered your question friend if you have anymore ask away :) Oh man this would have to be around 1.5 years in.\\nIt was a ~19-21 year old, Romanian chick man she was gorgeous and she was companied by her mom too lol. \\n\\nAnyway the entire time they kept chatting with me and were genuinely so nice and friendly.\\n it felt like I knew them for a long time, yet we had only met and talked for what I think was ~15 min (total transport time)\\nLUCKILY enough I discharged her and was able to see/talk to her one more time... But damn she was beautiful. Woo Happy bday to you too CloudyIsSafeAsWell cheers mate! 🍻 I love Los Angeles!! so much do, and the food variety is top notch! what I DON\\'T like is how people just don\\'t give a fuck about keeping safe during these tough times. Especially in my neighborhood (South Central) many times you go to a liquor store mofos aren\\'t wearing masks and don\\'t care. that shit is annoying, especially given the fact I work at a hospital and see first hand how covid can affect your body. \\nIt just extends the amount of time we have to stay like this untill things go back to normal... Thanks willChangeMyNameLatr 🥳🥳(you never did did you lol) \\n\\nWelp here\\'s to hoping things start to settle soon lol Happy birthday to your pops! Angriguru 🥳 Thanks Msink means a lot really! :\\')\\nHonestly my part in the healthcare system isn\\'t that stressful I\\'m in contact with my patients at max 45 minutes (if the transport is taking very long) but aside from that everything just seems like second nature now, the covid patients I move and that are vented is stressful cause it\\'s more exposure, but I make sure all my PPE is properly on and fitted before I move. \\n\\nI guess the most stressful thing is not being able to vent out at bars,clubs, raves, baseball games. Those were the places I let loose and let everything go and have fun, but none of that is open so I\\'m stuck at home bored and dealing with it sigh lol.

Honestly I can\\'t think of a patient that came in related to construction injury odd I know 🤔 I\\'ll say this though my uncle many years ago (stupidity) was using a circular saw cutting a 2x4 hanging from his leg.... Well let\\'s just say HIGH RPM and blood makes for an interesting painting..... 🤦🏽\\u200d♂️ He is good though but man was that dumb. \\n\\nDude had a butt plug stuck inside cause he fell asleep while.... Having fun... Interesting convo as I took him to pre-op but boi did I laugh after words. The guy was cool though, albeit embarrassed lol Wow great question..... \\nIt\\'s wierd really. For me at least.\\n\\nDeath doesn\\'t seem to affect me much. My great grandma died a year ago but working at a hospital I\\'ve just kind of learned that death is just life people live people die. It\\'s a way of life nothing we can do,the world just keeps on spinning.maybe that\\'s made me a bit cynical idk but that\\'s one. \\n\\n2. I\\'ve definitely taken the \"fuck it, full send\" mentality. Which is if you have money and time to do something do. It\\'s better to have said \"I did it\" than saying \"I wish I was there\"  this one comes from the numerous young fatalities and realizing these kids never lived life to the absolutely fullest.... And I\\'m only 25.\\n\\nSo yeah I do appreciate things way more now, but at the same time I\\'ve learned to just let things go with the bad times in life. \\nHope that answered your question I could\\'ve gone in mor detail but I\\'m answering EVERY question on here lol\\nIf you have more ask away :) Thanks TomDaNub3719 have a good one mate! 🍻 Thanks AJ22468!!! 🍻\\n25 years young \\nAnd every year for the past 3 years it\\'s been my thing to go out to a Latino club with a bunch of friends and just dance\\n I may not be the best dancer but I do enjoy a good time with friends 😌 So I\\'m a a transporter INSIDE the hospital I don\\'t move patients from hospital to hospital. \\n\\nI do move patients from \\nThe E.R to thier room\\nTransfer them from room to room\\nDischarge them (when they finally go home yay!)\\nTake deceased patients to the morgue (yes you read that right and I have to open the body bag to make sure it\\'s the right person)\\nAnd pretty much anything related with moving patients I do. With some exceptions that is. \\n\\nHope that cleared up some confusion and if you have a new question with the added details by all means ask :) So far it\\'s meh, but I have a bday dinner with a select few friends at thier house so it should be fun I\\'ll probably play some fall guys on PS4 for a bit and then do some work outs to get my body energized. Lol Thanks mate cheers 🍻 👍 Hmmmm good question... As far as I can no... There have been many OD (OVER DOSES)  but I have no clue if it was suicide or not (the patient was out cold, and I\\'m obviously not going to ask the patient when they are alert) \\nAnd it\\'s not late it\\'s Aug 11 (here in the Los Angeles so ask away I\\'ve been answering everyone :) ) I meant why would he wait so long so say I need help lol.thats what I meant. \\nNonetheless I hope is doing well now. 👍 Fuck that I\\'d rather look like a pussy than bleed the fuck out! I guess even with so much experience something like is bound to happen hopefully nothing like that has happened and won\\'t happen again! Happy birthday fellow leo 🥳🥳🍻🍻🍻 Thanks friend much appreciated 🥳🍻🍻 Pizza burgers and is that STRAWBERRIES on a cake 😤😤 \\nFun fact about me I do NOT like strawberries AT ALL lol\\n\\nJokes aside thanks friend cheers much appreciated 🍻🥳 I\\'m holding up ok to be honest I haven\\'t contacted anything (thankfully) and eyup there are a good amount of them all around the hospital I wouldn\\'t be able to give you an estimate though as everyday patients come and go.

I should get more into cheese cause I LOVE IT but pepper jack I know boring :/ any recommendations? 😊 now why the hell would he do that lmao now THATS an idiot lmao 😂 Thank you very much?\\n\\nIf we throwing insults for fun here in that case \\n\\nThank you very much smegma dingle berry breath! 😂 Yeah I guess weirdest encounter with a patient Hello birthday twin . Happy birthday!! \\n\\nIt\\'s your birthday now Thanks friend we are just doing what we can. I hope all is well in life now! The name is a bit of a meme, never used bitcoin. Lol. It\\'s my birthday too! Happy birthday! Nice, happy birthday Happy birthdays!!! Yikes, I couldn\\'t imagine refusing treatment because they didn\\'t like the room, was there anything wrong with it? cant imagine not wanting treatment just because of a room, i was in the ICU for a month and i had a terrible view out of the window, i was bedridden for the entire stay in the ICU aswell.\\n\\n(Heart transplanted)\\n\\nAlso do you ever crash into things when transporting patients? like bump into walls or have you mastered the skill? my nurses told me they spent an entire day learning how to make a bed, but spent no time learning how to drive them. So basically, they\\'d rather die than go inside of a room they don\\'t like\\n\\nGood to know they have their priorities straight I was talking about an amazon wishlist so I could gift you something for your birthday, but oh well guess I\\'ll have to fight corona now , better get ready ! thanks for ur answer!! Btw i think that ur work is very important, expecially because i am going to be in the army and all medical staff are like angels for us Not a problem. Hope you can celebrate eventually Hell yeah, i love pizza parties. Enjoy the next one ! ( greetings from France) You went from professional adult, to idiot drunk hyper emoji fuckwit, in like fuck all hours. same i couldnt celebrate either south east asia :) That’s the best kind of person IMO. Hope you’re having a great day!! Happy 25! Thank you! Hope today has been great for you! 😄 Happy birthday to you too Willsmith69420!!!\\n had to have those number combos huh? hahaha. Cheers Thanks! I’m basically the mayor of squaresville over here so I was really just hoping to get slightly tipsy on wine in Montreal (18 is the legal drinking age) but that dream is tarnished haha Oh jeez that sounds like a nightmare! Thanks for the reply! Awesome, hope you have the best time Cheers! 🍻🎉🥳\\n\\nHmm... I really haven\\'t had too many scary moments. My favorite climbing is lead and or trad climbing outdoors and I try to make sure I don\\'t do anything above my skill level. So I guess my scariest moment would be when I was lead climbing and a storm rolled through and started raining on me 🤔 the rock was definitely a little slippery! I was protected from the rain until I had to top out and get our gear. Last couple moves were a little sketch. We had some absolute amazing transporters who at least acted like they loved their jobs. It made such a huge difference for everyone. I hope you can share this post with your coworkers for some inspiration. Grazie and likewise! Cheers!\\n\\n\\nAnd it did awnser my question, thank you! Im glad it\\'s not too stressful of a job... I probably couldn\\'t do anything like that. XP Cheers! Yea I don\\'t get why wearing a mask is so difficult.\\n\\nIs LA as expensive at it seems? I\\'ve always wanted to live in a big city when I get older. Ur welcome. I realized right after that u can\\'t change ur  Reddit usernames haha He says thanks! You too 😀 Who doesn’t? I hope it gets less hectic for you sometime soon, I can only imagine If you\\'re in LA I probably was one of those OD\\'s sadly.. ;-; I\\'ve been to 7 hospitals for unintentional OD unfortunately, 2 we\\'re in San Bernardino County, 3 were in LA county and the other 2 was orange county. 4 of them were intentional. 🍨🍰🎂🍦🍭🍧 But...I thought they were cherries  😂Opps, forgot something 🎈 [deleted] Hmmmm this one is tuff cause I see a LOT of wierd shit.\\n\\nBut encounter wise I was moving a patient once that was OUT LOUDLY hitting on almost every female we passed by and the patients even caressed the hair of a few docs (I tried stopping him, but moving a bed and I.V pole with both hands makes that very difficult 😬) \\n\\nSo yeah that was a very awkward/wierd couple minutes...\\n\\nNow if you would\\'ve said scary/Gore-iest/saddest that\\'s a different story. Happy birthday to you too cheers mate 🍻🥳 Thank you friend!!! :) Damn could\\'ve been mighty rich right about now 😏😂 (I\\'ve been waiting to say this my entire life)\\n\\nSame to you Happy birthday!!! ok tbf the room they had (still a private one) was in an overflow area, an extension of the E.R if you will. \\n\\nSo it was a big area with some privates walled off rooms (which my patient was already assigned to)\\n\\nThey didn\\'t like the fact that outside of thier room against the walls were other beds and only curtains separating them. Believe me I thought the same fucking thing. Some people can be real picky and it blows my mind. Smh\\n\\nSome of our ICU rooms have windows BEHIND the bed so the patients that are alert can\\'t even see outside consider your self lucky :/\\n\\nSeems like everything went well I\\'m glad your still here with us friend 🥳\\n\\nHahaha naw at this point (almost 3 years doing this) I\\'ve mastered the craft. Many nurses have told me how much of a good driver I am fitting through tight hallways, maneuvering around people ECT. Like anything with practice comes confidence. And I\\'m very confident in my handling of the bed. \\nBUT when there are many I.V lines and other things that can be caught and potentially rip off I do take my time and make sure Everything is good before trying to get in a tight space.\\n\\nWith that being yeah of course I\\'ve bumped into things, not at full speed never that but sometimes it\\'s just unavoidable. For instance, many of our rooms entrances give us a few inches of play to go in with the bed so sometimes I purposely bump the side of the bed a bit on the door frame for leverage to turn the bed (when I\\'m transporting solo)\\n\\n\\nThe hardest things to move are some of the ICU/air beds (air mattress beds) because they are battery operated (we they essentially drive them selves) BUT when those fucking beds have no power get ready to move a 300+ lb bed PLUS whatever the patients weights (imagine pushing a large 4 wheeled wagon with 500lbs with one hand while holding on to an I.V pole with the other it\\'s happened to me but in those cases I OBVIOUSLY ask the nurses to help out.... IF they are transporting with me.) Believe me I was dumbfounded but whatever it\\'s thier life not mine can\\'t force them to do anything. What can you do 🤷🏽\\u200d♂️ You are kidding I would never allow that to happen\\n but if there is something on my wishlist it\\'s \\na new ps4 controller \\nAnd an SNES classic :\\'( lol Hey thanks my friend!!\\nBest of luck out thier serving US be safe and a word of advice from a cousin who was...IS a marine. He liked keeping a lil journal and dotting stuff down from time to time as time went on as he deployed. He looks back on it and relives fun moments. Idk if you\\'ll be able to do that but meh I figured I\\'d throw that out there.\\n\\nHave a good one!! I\\'ma still celebrate just NOT how I wanted too, I should\\'ve been more clear on that 😅 il y avait un peu de sarcasme dans ma réponse. nous sommes un peu fatigués de la pizza ici haha lol Who says I wasn\\'t already drinking before I started this thread??? Also\\n\\nWith all the crap going on in the world, and dealing with covid face to face, any small glimpse of fun you can find to break the monotony of recent months you take it and run with. \\n\\nSo idk if you\\'re being serious with this response or not, but I\\'m having a blast responding to everyone like y\\'all are my friends, so I\\'ll respond like so if that\\'s so bothersome so be it sue me. \\n\\nAll in all though I\\'m still having a blast responding to EVERYONE. :) Since I woke up I haven\\'t stopped responding to EVERY question I\\'m having a blast so far lol. But the day has JUST begun it\\'ll get better lol Some for you Pffffttt don\\'t event worry about the square thing, you do what you enjoy and don\\'t let anyone tell you other wise. Just go buy yourself a bottle and enjoy it at the comfort of your home no shame in that, drink as you listen to your favor songs. You do you friend you\\'ll enjoy it and won\\'t regret it :)\\n\\nThe amount of times friends have called me a bitch etc because I don\\'t want to take hella shots at parties is countless but I know my limits and I know I don\\'t do good with shots. (anymore) so no nasty hangover, and I remember the night so it\\'s a win win for me!lol Yeah it was awkward thankful it was a quick job and it was finished within like 15in I felt bad 😭 Yeah I genuinely love what I do I see the ins and outs of a hospital and that to me very intriguing! many nurses ask how I have the energy to stay so uppity at 3/4 in the morning, but I can\\'t go into a patient\\'s room with out some kind of flare. Every patient of mine gets treated with respect and kindness. It\\'s the least they deserve no matter what crap life has thrown thier way. \\nWill do when I go back on Thursday!! Thanks again for the question I\\'ve been having a blast responding to everyone :) Believe me this is probably the least stressful job in healthcare in direct contact with patients. I only see my patients max 45 min (if the transport is taking long) after that the nurses take care of them... Untill they are good to go home... Or well die... Personally I don\\'t think I\\'d be able to bag a deceased patient, because I feel like I would get too attached and would be heartbroken. But that\\'s just me. :/ Yes it absolutely is freaking expensive I\\'m not even going to lie to you :/ Mmhhmmm suuurrree 🧐 lol have a good one mate! Honestly I don\\'t see things getting better until AFTER August next year the earliest. Well my friend let me extend a hand of friend ship and say if you ever need a person to talk to and vent with 0 judgment and like memes and dark humor I\\'m your guy I hope things are looking up for you now. Don\\'t hesitate to reach out the worst that can happen is I\\'m busy and teapot late stay with us friend you are loved here 😌💙 Aren\\'t they strawberries I can\\'t really tell lol I\\'ll take your word for it YUM!\\nAND THANKs for the balling time for hi pitched voices lol. [deleted] I’m interested in hearing all three if you don’t mind sharing? Have a good one from Ireland 👍 I\\'ll just send you some cheap drugs that I stole from the mafia Bruh now I have to give you a ps4 controller and fight corona that shit do be hard though not a problem my friend, btw i will serve italy, not us, but is basically the same because italy and US are allied.I hope to end up in the rear instead of in the front lines. I have great potential as a strategist and leader Fair enough lol, all my birthdays aren’t celebrated how i want First! Of all!\\n\\nI love how wer\\'e acting like logs person in the wild. Like fuck you, you fucking fuck.\\n\\nAlso, where do I piss in this place?\\n\\nThanks man, your ride is shit. Mine is better. No. Mine is fucking terrible. Haha.\\n\\nI too, am drunk. But seriously. I hate emojis. I don\\'t r really know why, but may be I can\\'t meme but at least I cant splle. \\n\\nAnyhoo. Fuck you\\'re fucking fucks.\\n\\nMuch love and crazy over take maneuver. Hah true... I’m working east coast hours which is why I think it’s so late already. Thats what I thought, unfortunately Probably not but one can always hope Thank you.. really needed that. Happy birthday to you and thank you for your sacrifice of being on the front lines of this pandemic. Need the tea sis HIPPA and what not means I won\\'t go into detail regarding the patients. But\\n\\nSaddest:\\n1. Being called up to move a 4 week old deceased patient to the morgue, which was wierd because we never do them. I get up there I see the baby.... Such an innocent soul. Gone. :/\\n2. Early late teen/early 20\\'s kid. Thier mom comes to the E.R because her son has been shot dead.... The screams of a mother crying over her child will still gets me.\\n\\nGore:\\nHaven\\'t really been part of a mangled mess. But I did have to take a deceased patient from the E.R to the morgue and the Floor and some of the walls/cabinets were drenched in blood (I saw this before it was somewhat cleaned up for us to go in)\\n\\nScariest:\\nOnly once has this happened to me (I work night shifts)\\nBut walking down a long hallway empty and silent As fuck and the lights starts flicker on and off.... FUUUUUCCCKKK THAT, I thought I was in a horror movie for a bit it\\'s been the only time it\\'s happened so far and I was legit scared 😂😂\\n\\nAnd I guess it\\'s seeing covid + ICU patients hooked up to a bunch of stuff and vents down thier throats and realizing many people that think it\\'s a hoax won\\'t see this part and realize it\\'s not, so they\\'ll continue on like nothing wrong so this shit will keep on spreading EXTENDING the days we return to fucking normal. (Sorry for the language but Man I\\'m fed up with people not taking this shit serious) Oh man a buddy of mine is planning a bachelor party in Dublin once all this is over I can\\'t wait to visit and see the views! Cheers! orange Tesla\\'s and shrooms only please. Fuck it I\\'ll take acid tabs too I guess.

If they aren’t it’s illegal to pay them to fly, I’m not sure if the person paying them can be held responsible but it is best to know if they do have that certification, also make sure they at minimum hold a current level 2 medical certificate. That can be granted by a doctor, though they need a specific certification also, but that is an easy google search. What was the most outrageous question/request that you were asked after you won? What was the first thing you bought with your millions what was your initial reaction when you found out you won? What was the first thing you brought with the money? Did you get addicted to drugs.? Congrations! Congrats! Have you told any friends? If not, how do you justify getting suddenly rich? How long did it take after the drawing for you to check your ticket? Have you moved from your town (and if not, do you plan to leave and join high society)? What\\'s your favorite place you\\'ve traveled to? How old are you? What’s been your experience with women? How do you figure out their intentions while dating? 70% of lottery winners end up broke after seven years of winning the lottery and some even end up dead. What are some precautions you have taken to avoid these situations? Get Reddit premium to prove yourself What\\'s it like living stress free? What car do you drive? What is the one thing you kind of want to buy because you can, but haven’t because you don’t want to spend the money? Can I have a reddit award? No question really but I want to rather warn you. I have seen lots of lives ruined after winning the lottery. Don’t EVER go near drugs. Ik I’m being such a mom rn but not worth it. Also, have like 5 million dollar set aside that you would not touch at all to support your lavish life. Never borrow money from the bank. And I think you’d be good. I mean 50 million is a lot. Even if you don’t invest at all, that’s like getting one million dollars every year (if you lived for 50 years, that is). Also, don’t forget to give to charities and good causes because maybe there’s an afterlife. Good luck ❤️ I tried to buy 3 tickets the other day, my first 3. Thats when i found out you cant play the lottery at 19 in Az. What is the biggest change that the money has made in your life? How did your family and friends react and did they treat u differently than before? Did people come out of the woodwork once you won? How old are you? Are you married? And do you have kids? How did it feel being able to take care of your family? I would have to say that’s one thing I wish I could do for my mom one day, just buy her a house she wants and let her live life! \\n\\nAlso, congrats!! I’m\\nJealous Did you gave money to associations? If yes, which What can you still not have even with money? Did you upgrade your closet after your win? How much would you say you spent on new clothes, shoes, etc? Did you buy more high end fashion or stay cheap? Also did you start any collections or anything like that? And congratulations!! I’m really glad you’ve got the weight of debt and such off your shoulders! Enjoy your life :) Do you like do the best cocaine now Haha jk can you pay for my college tuition Will you invest in Shrek 5? Hello I\\'m trying to pay a lawyer to see my daughter again, I can send you redacted emails to prove it. Are you able to help? Just need to finish paying her but i was laid off due to COVID. What’s your best ‘if money wasn’t an object’ realization? I feel like I say that phrase a lot, and then if it were to come true one day, a simple thing may be a true lightbulb moment! \\nCongratulations on your win! I think it’s really cool :) How old are you? How did you first feel in that moment when you found out? Are you married if so are you planning on staying married? (I’m engaged so not asking because of that 😂)when people win money they always say they are going to leave their significant other lol! What are your plans over the next 5 years with the money you have? Man wtf... man I\\'m so jealous what the hell Did you feel like you could lose your ticket or get it swindled from you when you were working with the Lawyer? What other types of professionals have you hired to help you with legalities and finances? Sorry but do you have any proof? After the brain cancer kid I don’t believe much on this sub anymore Would you consider paying my college tuition? What\\'s life like in Moraine? Can I have some [deleted] Can I have some? Also, how much was left after taxes? Ah is that you? Hey man I don’t want silver or gold can you send $15 cash so I can buy a new lightbulb I’ve been wanting for a while? When exactly did you win it? Do you have the original winning ticket? Could you share it with us (not the winning sum that comes with it, obviously)? Link? Lemmie hold like $500..... 🤣🤣 But that\\'s what\\'s up I\\'m happy for you. Donate to the humane society of craven county, NC they need some help? It\\'s local to where I live. Give me an iPhone 11pro max. That\\'s all I want. 😂 Can I have some? I desperately need a new computer. Seven hundred dollars would be a blessing and even a dollar would be welcomed. Spare some change? Invest in me\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/logan.saylors.372 It was a question why are you sorry?? well and I am here searching online for a scholarship for undergraduate degree for I won\\'t be able to study in college without it. I am a succesful student of an unsuccesful family. Why you lying? Dang bro, thats a dream come true. If you wanna waste money of stupid reddit awards I exist (jk I am not beggar) Can I have a grand? Can u give me 1 mil ??? And how much u get back after taxes Can you help me buy my first property in Chicagoland area? You\\'ll have a free bed to sleep in any time you\\'re here. I gave them 2wks notice and told them my grandfather brought me on to manage his trust fund. $12/hr\\n\\nEnjoy your silver  Enjoy your gold Had someone ask that I pay for their college. I asked for transcripts and turns out they\\'ve been on academic probation for years with a 1.5 GPA\\n\\nHad someone ask that I pay for their house which was supposedly destroyed in a tornado. They sent me pictures, reverse image search revealed that the pictures had been taken years ago and in a different state.\\n\\nHad someone ask that I invest in their energy drink startup. It failed that same year. \\n\\nSomeone came forward wanting me to help them open a restaurant. They had no food service experience.\\n\\nSomeone wanted me to help bail them out of jail. He had beat the shit out of his gf. I\\'ve invested well\\n\\nTo prove it, here\\'s a dumb reddit award Mega millions Probably the vast majority, but my Assets equate to the same amount I just spent like $4. Never again My parents were always very supportive throughout my whole life, the least I can do is return the favor. \\n\\nMy brother\\'s an asshole but I take care of him too. Whim Trevor Project, NILC, Prevent Child Abuse America, Vests for life, and a lot of local HS music programs I paid off my families debts and they have credit cards under my account. They know I got them covered >How long have you been living the rich life\\n\\nMore than a year\\n\\n>how has it adjusted your relationship with the world?\\n\\nI\\'m a lot more private now. I\\'m not very involved with social media and I\\'m much more wary of the intentions of others.\\n\\n>Do you have any experiences with the negative aspects of a windfall?\\n\\nThere are times I\\'m awake at night just worrying about everything. I get angry messages from entitled people who don\\'t know I won the lottery, but know I\\'m rich and want a slice. Actually my family roots are Irish and German! Shock and awe. My dad was really worried I\\'d blow all of it and end up in debt forever. A condo for me. Bunch of rental props and land for developing. Debt isn\\'t neccesarily a bad thing, but cancel out as much irrelevant stuff as possible. Too many people pay for Hulu, Netflix, Spotify, Disney+, and Prime only to use like 1 or two of them Invest in a low cost S&P 500 index fund. Only keep enough money in savings to get you out of trouble if something happens. Invest the rest. Dont invest into bitcoin or some fad. Don\\'t go on r/wallstreetbets I don\\'t buy things in grocery stores that I consider to be too expensive. \\n\\nThe closest store to me is a Whole Foods, so I generally shop there. I avoid as much of the \"organic\" or \"GMO free\" shit I can, because it\\'s more expensive.\\n\\nIf a store has a rewards program or something, I sign up for it. No, plenty of investors already Probably not, sorry. Only immediate family. \\n\\nThey are actually very responsible and respectful What is your platform By voting you mean funding your campaign right? $6 my entire life 5. I wasn\\'t very happy No, but money buys freedom. With freedom comes the ability to find happiness in simple, everyday things like waking up and having absolutely nowhere you need to be. I don\\'t need to \"hunt\" Not too difficult. I had the same problems everyone has not long ago (student debt, rent, etc)\\n\\nI have tons of middle class friends that have no idea im rich Took a few weeks to claim the money. The majority. I\\'ll buy my family whatever they want. I don\\'t buy very many expensive things day to day I structured most of the money into some funds!\\n\\n>Best purchases you\\'ve made?\\n\\nMy Ferrari 458 spider, my condo, a classic truck for my dad, etc\\n\\n>Worst purchases you made?\\n\\nThe HiCan \"smart bed\". It\\'s really nice but most of the app functions don\\'t work and the fragrance diffuser stopped working almost instantly Yes! I\\'ve been to most of Europe and Asia! >What do you waste money on now that you didn\\'t used to?\\n\\nBottled water \\n\\n>And do you have many new hobbies?\\n\\nKayaking, shooting, jetskiing! The numbers matched I tipped a former coworker of mine (who I used to work at a sports bar with) $500 one time! \\n\\nJust came in, made casual convo, and tipped her on the receipt. She\\'s a mother and it was almost Christmas time.\\n\\nShe called me several times afterwards probably to thank me and I just never answered. \\n\\nThere\\'s some other examples of this as well Two. I have a condo. >What was the first thing you bought?\\n\\nTechnically my lawyer\\'s services. After that, my debt. After that, I bought a Mercedes Benz GLC43 AMG.\\n\\n>Did you take the lump sum or installed payments?\\n\\nLump sum I had some people claim to be distant relatives lmao The thing I enjoyed most was my very first supercar, a pre-owned Ferrari 458 Spider. People don\\'t know I won the lottery neccesarily. But when you\\'re driving a Ferrari in a small town (where my parents live), word spreads fast. Person is lying. >do you still have a job \\n\\nNot technically, but I am passively managing my investments (meaning someone else handles them but I oversee them and make decisions)\\n\\n>2 odd question when you die will you have an elaborate funeral like a big tomb or an eccentric burial like a sky burial\\n\\nHaha as of now my will calls for a burial in my hometown. Maybe I\\'ll blow myself up in the desert instead. Who knows. Forever 21 I mentioned them up above I\\'m heavily considering this I dont have a personal trainer but I work out a lot. \\n\\nI got a lot of much needed dental work done. \\n\\nToo many (according to mom) tattoos\\n\\nLearned some other languages More than a year Mostly hang out at the house since covid. \\n\\nBefore that I was travelling a lot Over half once you consider income tax My lawyer\\'s services I love pizza, but when you have \"real\" Pizza in Rome, nothing compares anymore QP! Longshot Various funds, real estate, and some other things. CDs etc Tax Almost all Probably my first sports car, a Ferrari 458 Spider I told immediate family after I successfully claimed the winnings I spent $4 on coins. Lmao. 20+ messages of profanity. \\n\\nNot many people I won the lotto, they just assume I got rich More than half after income tax Over half all things considered I would, but private air travel is too wasteful for me.\\n\\nYou should work at Delta! They\\'re great My lawyer\\'s services technically. I didn\\'t sleep for a few nights My lawyer\\'s services. \\n\\nEveryone asks this question but the answer is always boring No >Have you told any friends?\\n\\nI didn\\'t really have friends beforehand. I haven\\'t told anyone besides family.\\n\\n>If not, how do you justify getting suddenly rich?\\n\\nI just claim my grandfather, who was a wealthy oil executive, brought me on to manage his trust fund\\n\\n>How long did it take after the drawing for you to check your ticket?\\n\\nI checked it a few minutes after the drawing! \\n\\n>Have you moved from your town \\n\\nYes, to the capital city.\\n\\n>do you plan to leave and join high society)?\\n\\nI guess I\\'m technically a part of \"high society\" now. I live in a very high end condo complex\\n\\n>What\\'s your favorite place you\\'ve traveled to?\\n\\nAmalfi. Mid 20s It\\'s hard trusting women. I had a lot of girls come to my house and start taking Tik Toks and shit flexing my stuff That\\'s because they spend the money as soon as they get it, not knowing they have to pay another 30% or more on it after the first year.\\n\\nOr they start businesses with little experience. The majority of startups fail. No So good. I rotate between a Lamborghini Urus, Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead, and a truck Bugatti Veyron No work I only told family, they were shocked. We are closer now than we ever have been Some people I went to HS with messaged me to \"check up\" on me when they never cared before. \\n\\nI\\'m single.\\n\\nNo kids Our family is closer than ever >How much would you say you spent on new clothes, shoes, etc?\\n\\nToo much\\n\\n>Did you buy more high end fashion or stay cheap?\\n\\nCustom Louis Vuitton Varsity Jacket, Dior Biker, the LV Virgil Denim Jacket, a few LV Graphic Tees, some Gucci stuff, some stuff from the Dept. De la Gallerie collection, the Versace cowboy patches Jacket, some Amiri jeans, few odds and ends. The majority of my closet is Topman, Asos, and American Eagle lol\\n\\n>Also did you start any collections or anything like that? \\n\\nSome hyped sneakers. Not much of a collection No Transcripts >How old are you?\\n\\nMid 20s\\n\\n>How did you first feel in that moment when you found out?\\n\\nUtter shock and disbelief \\n\\n>Are you married if so are you planning on staying married?\\n\\nSingle\\n\\n>What are your plans over the next 5 years with the money you have?\\n\\nInvest and travel, as I have been doing The trust was in place before his office took possession of the ticket. I was slightly worried, but he would\\'ve had no way to claim the ticket. \\n\\nI have two accountants and an investment planner. You should take everything with a grain of salt. Even on r/IamA.\\n\\nI\\'m not going to supply any info that would identify me. Just pretend everything is creative writing on Reddit. Lemme see your transcripts I dont know what that is This is how much that was left after the initial tax AND the first year income tax. I used this number intentionally because both taxes vary state by state, and it makes it much more difficult to determine the jackpot amount Have we talked before? That\\'s a lot for a lightbulb Can\\'t give that info, as it would identify me The lottery office takes it. huh Who knows You can have a grand ole time Very graceful. I\\'d be pissed if I was someone\\'s manager and they told me to fuck off because they\\'re now a millionaire. Kudos to you Classy! I\\'m a supervisor and people that quit with no notice are assholes. Psha you should be doleing out the plat, bro. I\\'m guessing/hoping you turned down all of this. People just don\\'t seem to understand the concept that knowing someone with money =\\\\= having money. Do what\\'s best for you, this was your luck not theirs, and it sounds like you\\'ve handled it very responsibly God dammit. Can I have one 👉🏻👈🏻 What was it like going to the office to get the money? Did you opt for lump sum? Could you remain anonymous? Why? Was nobody grateful? My 2 brothers ars annoying to the rest and my parents are anti vaxx karens that blame me for everything. Wish they were normall :( I bought tickets for over 20 years & never won anything worth mentioning. Meanwhile my father won 100k & tried to get back into my life by dangling $ over me.  Said no despite kind of needing the money because he wasn\\'t worth it.     \\nCongrats though, at least you\\'ve done something decent with your winnings Amazing causes, good on you! TREVOR PROJECT? GOD BLESS YOUR SOUL. Well from your comments it sounds like you\\'ve taken good precautions and are about a sensible as a lottery player can be. \\n\\nDo you mind me asking, finally, whether you still work, or if not, what you have been occupying your time with since? Sweet. Im torn between a prebuild condo or chunk of land. That makes sense. My hope is to not worry about bills one day. Thank you for the advice Thank you for your fast response! That’s good to hear. I wish you nothing but luck. Enjoy, you deserve it:) Transparency in government/civilian interaction. Universal basic income and universal basic healthcare. Anti-Party, anti-corruption actions.\\n\\nProtections for those who cannot protect themselves. Reduction of the industrial private prison complex and the end to the war on drugs.\\n\\nEquality of opportunity for all.\\n\\nIf you want to know more, I have a sub. Always looking for active discussion.  r/SPC_2028 Best six dollars ever spent or nah? And now? \\n\\nDo you wake up wake up everyday thinking \"fuck yeah I\\'m rich\", or do this lifestyle also come with unforeseen challenges? This is what I’ve always imagined. Having freedom doesn’t make life perfect, but it seems to make it way more peaceful. Congratulations on winning! I guess 10,000,000 1 dollar bills should be enough to craft a paper mache girlfriend In your 20s?  I didn’t have any middle class friends when I was at that age.  Are your friends older than you? Wow.... so are you living a good life in a pool in a mansion with a Ferrari? Or is it not the usual cliche winning the lottery? You\\'d be a great grandparent then. I wish I had a rich family member. My mom/dad never buy me anything.. my first electronic was a hand-me-down from my uncle. Srry, but my friend asked u if you could check out his go fund me... :(\\ngf.me/u/yk35k6\\nYou dont have to donate anything to him, but i did promise him i would send it. Okay That\\'s super neat! If it were me, I\\'d pay off my family\\'s debt & my own, buy some land & build a custom home. I\\'d give my family members money to build their own houses too. And, of course, get a few more rescues. I have 2 already. But only so much room right now. I\\'d probably be pretty modest with my money tbh. I\\'m pretty low maintenance & would probably keep it low key. \\nOh, I would travel too. Have you considered traveling at all? Where would you like to go? Nice! I loved the little bit of Europe I went to last year, hope we both get to enjoy some more after all this Covid stuff is over. I was wondering more if it was the Powerball or Mega Millions. As a former waiter, I applaud you for that, kind soul 👏 Condom. Good choice Smart. Are you from a big city or a small town? Why would people be contacting you if you stayed anonymous? Nice. Ferrari’s are cool but my dream car is a Bugatti Chiron Super Sport. Wow.  Interesting.  Thanks for the quick response! Btw you are a big lotto winner but not a big loser Nice enjoy life bro be safe That is my dream car Fair enough.  I’m jealous AF though either way!  I’ve planned out my lotto scenario in my head for years.  Half to friends/family/various charity, keep other half to pay off debts and secure my family’s future for the next generation or so.  \\n\\nHope you find happiness if you haven’t already. What was your initial reaction to the winning? That’s understandable for sure, and yeah they’re one of the companies I’m thinking of for working towards. I did a tour of one of their facilities and the people I was with were amazing. I’ve been on the larger planes for vacations and such but I never realized how big the engines REALLY are until I stood next to one. I’m 6’4’ and could easily stand inside of some of the intakes for those That is a good idea. What was the best thing you bought for yourself.? Very cool. In my \\'winning the lottery\\' plan, hiding it from the people around me (besides my immediate family) is what I always get stuck on. I think I\\'ll go with \" I\\'m an investment manager for a high net worth client,\" in which the client is me. Have you played the lottery since then, and how long did it take you to get the hang of managing the money? Wooooo!!!! You\\'re whole life to enjoy it! Also where you on the news Nice I understand if you don’t want to give your age but could you give a general age of how old you are when you won it? That’s awesome to hear!\\n\\nDo you ever plan on working again? I always felt like if I won enough to retire I’d still have a part time job doing something. I don’t know why 🤷🏼\\u200d♂️ Wow thanks for the quick response! https://imgur.com/a/vdA7cgl\\n😞 Good deal congrats 👍 You don’t have to show anything that would identify you I got a 3.8 \\\\*Portsmouth You did this ama before right? Do you, atleast, remember any info about it? Proof you are lying. You could of just said I\\'m not lying, but instead you said something that implies you could be lying, and I think you did that cause you\\'re a liar. I was a manager as well, I know You get what you get and you don\\'t throw a fit Sure 🥇 >What was it like going to the office to get the money?\\n\\nI did not go to the lottery office, a lawyer did on my behalf, as he represented the trust I opened to stay anonymous. \\n\\n>Did you opt for lump sum?\\n\\nThe lump sum is the best financial decision, so yes\\n\\n>Could you remain anonymous?\\n\\nAnswered above Kinda dumb lol Good on you for sticking to your guns. recently my dad won $500 and we used it to buy new shoes and clothes for school. it really helped my family since the extra $600 stopped and now itll be hard to just get food My brother is gay and I unconsciously bullied him for a while because of it. I was ignorant.\\n\\nI donate to try and make amends with myself and the lord I have a few investments which I passively manage. \\n\\nI do probably 8 hours of \"work\" a week. Land chunk if you can afford to develop Probably 8. \\n\\nLittle of both. \\n\\nI swear I get audited every year by the IRS Or buy one of those wacky Japanese dolls.\\n\\nKidding. Maybe Most of my friends are students at a college that I live right next to. Private school.\\n\\nThey\\'re generally the same age. I have a few friends in their 30s as well I dont have a mansion but used to have a Ferrari! **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\\n\\n* [gf.me/u/yk35k6](https://gf.me/u/yk35k6)\\n\\n*I did the honors for you.*\\n\\n***\\n\\n^[delete](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fu%2FLinkifyBot&subject=delete%20g15o761&message=Click%20the%20send%20button%20to%20delete%20the%20false%20positive.) ^| ^[information](https://np.reddit.com/u/LinkifyBot/comments/gkkf7p) ^| ^<3 >I\\'d pay off my family\\'s debt & my own\\n\\nDid it!\\n\\n>buy some land & build a custom home\\n\\nThinking about it!\\n\\n>Have you considered traveling at all?

The Chiron is a bit much for me. Someone at the car meets I attend owns one and has over 10k miles on it. They\\'re unbelievable cars. \\n\\nI looked into Veyrons before! Miller Motorcars offers complimentary service for a few years on them ($100k+ value), but I can\\'t justify owning something like that. \\n\\nMaybe someday. I am definitely a big loser lmao The engine note is insane Utter shock. I didnt sleep for days For sure. \\n\\nI meet a lot of pilots when I travel and one of my favorites was a Delta pilot. He had served in Desert Storm *AS WELL AS* Iraq. He reminded me a lot of Sully just the level of experience and professionalism you hear in the way he talks. A loooooooot of coke.\\n\\nKidding, I loved my Ferrari. I haven\\'t played since. \\n\\nI rely on 2 accountants and a financial planner to help me No. News doesn\\'t care if trusts win 20s It just doesn\\'t make any sense to Okay, what do you propose I show? Transcripts tho Yep I\\'m not going to give the winning numbers as that can be used to identify me. Lmao ok >to stay anonymous. \\n\\nConsidering all the afformentioned people from above it seems like you did not do a good job at this. Like isn\\'t the unofficial rule to tell absolutely no one? Like not your mother and not your child? Who did you tell? I respectively disagree. Kindness is not dumb, bitterness, selfishness etc is Thanks. Yea, I\\'ll be honest, that shit wasn\\'t easy but I can\\'t say I regret it. $500, Nice!  GG to your dad.\\nI feel you though. Going through some slightly tougher times myself currently. What matters is who you are now. In case you haven’t read my comment, I want to tell you one important thing about the lotto. For the wise, winning the lotto is a blessing; for the fool, it’s a curse. Statistics show the same thing. Hopefully you’d be wise about it. ❤️ The land i would sit on for a few years as where land is avail here isnt super sought after until development comes later on with the new highways. For that amount I would let IRS audit me everyday lol.\\n\\nI\\'m happy that things turned around for you (to say the least). Enjoy your life! That’s pretty cool! Thanks for answering my questions. I hope the rest of your life treats you well. Definitely lucky! Maybe I\\'ll snag a ticket next time I have a whim! Pure curiosity, what state do you live in? A buddy of mine has a theory that the big jackpot winners only happen on the East Coast. Thank you! Enjoy the rest of your AMA thread, as well as your well-executed security and comfort Thats cool and inspiring in a way to me lol. So people you know claimed to be distant relatives. You keep adding holes to your story. I’ve heard videos of it. I’m personally a Rari girl. I applaud your choice in cars Thanks for answering my questions hope you have a goode and prosperous life! Damn that’s pretty crazy. I wonder what branch he was in. And yeah the guys (and girls) in the major airlines definitely have a massive professional persona around them it seems like, I’m not sure what makes them seem like that. I’m guessing it’s so much time in that mindset that it’s completely natural to them. What was the best thing you bought for someone else.? Where did you win them from Nice that’s so cool mate! I know I don’t know u but I hope you kick ass and take names! 👍🏻 You could edit anything that gives away info out and show the lottery ticket if you still have it or something like that How? Have you shown your name publickly? Dad, mom, brother. \\n\\nI\\'d rather not win the money than keep my family in the dark. I meant \"kinda\" dumb he wanted to spend most of it at the casino like he does with a lot of our money, but my mom had a better idea and wouldnt let him use it so False, someone won in Arizona recently Okay let me spell it out for you, Detective. \\n\\nPeople I know from HS etc are the first ones to take notice. Word spreads. Within a few months I had 1000+ friend requests on Facebook, follow requests on insta, etc despite having LITERALLY not posting anything.\\n\\nThus, randos start appearing, who were referred to me from someone else. Or potentially alt accounts from people who I actually do know. \\n\\nThere you go. Make sense now? Thanks! I think I posted the full list of my cars here somewhere It\\'s badass whatever it is I bought a classic truck for my dad Walmart Every state has a different ticket format. Oh ok, i get that.  Well congratulations again. JEEEZ. Well, GG to your mom then! That’s good to know. Thanks. You are a liar. lol I’m happy for you. I hope everything works out well. Can’t argue with that Okay, thanks for the educated and rational reply You\\'re so rich omg uWu Cool Is it due to a karma crave ? You mean that you have actual hands? That\\'s crazy! Get out of hear, you liar! Send picks of your hands, or i don\\'t believe in whatever you say. Don\\'t worry, I will use them wisely. How does this work? i hate you Why are you such a nice person? How does anyone know who exactly upvoted them? You think so? \\n\\nThanks Np 2D - The Gorillaz Diagnose Peter Griffin. He is complex Kratos from god of war. Dory from finding nemo What do you mean? Day- from the legend book Homer Simpson Kyle Broflovski Joker from Persona 5, what do you say is wrong with him? Hisoka from Hunter x Hunter Takumi Fujiwara julian from wonder Naruto Bruce Wayne. Qui gon jinn Tomie. Antisocial Behavioral Disorder. Given that Peter has a tendency to show no remorse for any rules he may have broken, an example of this can be pulled from almost every episode. Kratos\\' story begins with him attempting suicide in a moment of despair. Kratos is a soldier with PTSD. I mean if you mention a character i will diagnose them with a mental illness looks like ADHD because of his hyperactive personality Hisoka seems to have sadistic personality like when he kills his victims he even licks his lips. He gets pleasure from victims pain and truly wants gon to suffer\\n\\n. > Takumi Fujiwara\\n\\nHe seems to have ADHD and is very hyperactive. Azula. Avatar: The last airbender.

Azula has schizoaffective disorder with hallucinations of her mom and mood swings interesting. have you ever diagnosed something in a real person? No this is for fun Can you front me this months rent? Are you set to inherit his worth or is he going to make you earn your own way. Can you buy whatever you want or do you worry about the amount of money you spend? What\\'s the worst thing you\\'ve ever done to yourself? Are you karma whoring?

No. I don\\'t even understand karma. It varies sometimes, 15 - 20 What’s something/someone that’s had a positive influence and has helped you get through such a difficult time? I’m glad you’re still here, I’ve been there before as well <3 What brought you back from going through with it? Congrats, and glad you are here!\\n\\nHow do you feel about it?, and what\\'s the biggest change that has brought you happiness ever since then? The legend of the Phoenix. When I was institutionalized for the first time, and I was expected to share my life story, someone said I had phoenix-tier resiliency. They made me a bracelet with letter beads spelling out the word. This idea, that every time I crash, it\\'s because I have the opportunity to pick up the pieces and build myself up stronger again, is what continues to drive me today. I have found that determination is so much better than stubbornness. So now, when I feel like I\\'m at rock bottom, instead of letting it consume me, I recognize that the only direction left to fly is up. Thank you so much, friend, and remain strong 💪 ❤ My best friend at the time. Thank you!! I used to mope around on the anniversary. Then it became a celebration. Now, it\\'s just a day to chill and  post an AMA, I guess. It\\'s a bit surreal every time this day comes around. As for happiness... still working on that one. I changed my habits and hobbies and got rid of toxic friends. Now I need to figure out how to make new ones. Thank you, stay strong, we got this! Your welcome! Is good that now you have something more to celebrate and share with others. And yet you have own it and made it more upbeat. Works in progress are the best because there are tons of choices you can make and in exchange discover something new about you. Good luck with making new friends, perhaps they will pop up in one of you daily activities or daily interests and will surprise you :)! What do you think is the secret that most relationships fail to figure out these days? Me n my gf are only 15 months but I\\'m really feeling this one and we\\'re still really great right now. I just want to know from someone like you cause there doesn\\'t seem to be many good examples anymore. My man 🍻\\n\\nDo you guys have kids? if you have kids that might be traumatic Communication is the most important thing. If you\\'re angry then tell your partner and talk it out like adults. If you like something tell them and  they\\'ll remember it and repeat it. This goes for meals they make, things they wear, things in bed, etc. If don\\'t like something then tell your partner. If you never say anything then your partner may never realize they do something that bothers you. Tell them your fears and desires. I grew up in a home where communication wasn\\'t a think. It took a LONG time before I could be open with my thoughts. Things get better the more we are open. Love her till your death. Love her like you\\'re her saviour, love her like you\\'re her Jesus, love her like you\\'re willing to die for her, love her like you\\'re not merely a man, but a God. You have to eat ass eventually Two kids ages 5 & 9. We have 2 kids but they\\'ve never caught us. How? I kinda think it\\'s better to show kids their parents love each other. Unless you consider sex is totally not about love, otherwise, why not? because no kid wants to think about their parents having sex unless they live in Alabama But they know, or they will know eventually. I am not telling you to demonstrate it before kids, it\\'s private of course. Our kids are 5 and 9 so when they are mature enough we will be very open about sex and how its not something to be ashamed of. For now we show affection in front of the kids. well also alot of the times you shouldn\\'t relay on sex to help your children understand that you love each other you should be able to show them that even outside of the bedroom What\\'s the most morbid wish youve received? Who hands down was the worst child you ever seen? YES! SANTA!\\n\\nMy mum loves mall Santas. We have a favourite one we visit every Christmas. I\\'m 23, she\\'s 49. We go talk to him and take pics and all. I was wondering if this is normal? That\\'s my general area! How do you handle the cold? are the suits isolated for the weather (Or wet things that may fall on your suit) do women ever have Santa fantasies they want you to help play out, or like fetishize you for being Santa? i\\'m thinking of the movie Bad Santa here - the woman who was totally turned on by the thought of sex with Santa. This looks like a very cheerful AMA during this times :)!\\n\\nWhat\\'s the most upbeat experience you have had as Santa within those years?, and how do you think this Christmas is going to be? The kid who wished his babysitter would die for not allowing him to play with his X-Box past his bedtime.\\n\\nI also had a kid wish for their dead father to come back and I, uh, needed a minute after that. When I started in this business, I did a gig near Detroit. One kid jumped off my leg, (he must\\'ve been 9 or 10) and he was behaved really well up until it was time to go, when he started running around the \"sleigh\" that was behind my chair and eventually jumped in it, before pulling some of the empty \"presents\" out of my \"bag\" and throwing them everywhere.\\nThe mom got involved, there was a fight, and it held up the line.\\n\\nAlso, one kid had some bladder control issues and pissed on my leg. Yuck. Yeah! Go ahead and take pictures with us, it\\'s fun. Just don\\'t do it when the line is too long, otherwise you might hold things up a little too long. My suit is mostly insulated from stuff like that. I usually tell kids I live at the North Pole, but I live near Midland, Michigan (which depending on the time of year, isn\\'t much different!) and often I\\'ll put the suit on shortly before arriving at the venue. Luckily I haven\\'t had a situation where it\\nThat being said, moisture has, uh, been an issue before, and it luckily is pretty good about keeping it out, and off of me.\\n\\nOn my way to a Christmas event in Ohio, I got pulled over wearing my suit. It was odd, to say the least! Ah, this is definitely the kind of question going on my \"naughty\" list.\\n\\nI have moms flirting all the time, it\\'s kind of normal. Comes with the territory. Without giving away too much, I\\'m happily married, and I\\'ve worked out a few funny lines I can use to reject the advance. \"Well, I don\\'t think Mrs. Claus would approve...\"\\n\\nI\\'ve been hit on by a Dad before. It was awkward. Also, there was a group of twenty-somethings dressed like toddlers (complete with a  pacifier) that gave off really kinky vibes and used it all as an excuse to flirt with me. Some people do weird things. I\\'ve gotten plenty of adults sitting on my lap. Some of us do have padding or frames in our legs to mitigate the weight of heavier children and non-children on our lap. The time a Dad came back from war and greeted his son as he left. This was kind of close to Joliet. Pretty much, the kid was really bummed and missed his dad, and I had gotten a note from the mom that kind of said \"act oblivious to it\" and so he runs up to his dad after leaving my lap. Brought a tear to my eye, and the next little girl yelled \"Santa\\'s crying!\"\\n\\nLike something out of a movie. Beautiful day, truly a Christmas miracle.\\n\\nWithout getting too political; I fear for how Christmas, and generally, life is going to be affected by the pandemic. I certainly hope that Christmas is a time where we come together, whether Republican or Democrat, Black or White, man or woman, etc. Christmas is a time of unity, and hopefully we can, just for one day, look past pandemics and politics and just come together as *people*. Even if you don\\'t believe in a Christ, we still can unite around Christmas, the time of year where everything is good. God see this is the reason i hate children  Thanks Santaaa <3 Your job is so appreciated! That\\'s heartwarming to know. That little kid got the best Christmas gift, you got to feel that joy and movie like experience while the kids got to see Santa\\'s emotional side. \\n\\nThat\\'s true, the pandemic has changed many things and created an outburst of underlying problems that have gotten worse. I guess that\\'s what makes holidays special, that just for a moment you can kinda forget about the problems and just celebrate. They\\'re alright, most issues are with the parents. Thanks! This comment is going on my nice list! It was amazing. That was a nice part of an otherwise terrible day. That day, my car got dented on the rear driver\\'s side door, and a kid almost had an accident on my leg.\\n\\nCouldn\\'t have said it better myself! Merry (early) Christmas. I definitely would say that the great moments make it all worth the bratty kids, ruined legs, and near heat-strokes that come with the territory. At least something positive happened during that day, and things didn\\'t went beyond repair. But yes the perks of being Santa.\\n\\nMerry (early) Christmas for you too!, and thank you for sharing with us. I love doing so. It makes the entire job worth it! \\n\\nMerry Christmas to you as well; you\\'re on the nice list, /u/See-My-Eyes! Is this question too vague for a good answer?

I hope you allow my sincere apology. I’m 13 and virgin My sister. The last 11 years Hello No but I would expect not kidnap just confiscate I have never applied for a job but I want to be a zookeeper A time It’s called “Reddit” a documentary about Reddit. It features the CEO and some of the most famous Redditors I appreciate bees, but don’t like being stun. Wasps are just a big no no I’m human and have thumbs I’m 13 and plan never to do drugs I was bored “Are what they say true” and “What’s your greatest fear” I’m trying to answer all the questions to make sure everyone feels important and gets an answer.

I do not have my resume on me. But my former secretary has it. You can call them at 583-297-4860 At the time of seeing this comment I was 14hrs in and it has exceeded my expectations. I was inspired because I was bored an curious of what people would come up with. These are *false* allegations Miss.Piggy’s dead sister By fingering did you mean petting? And I want to volunteer there to help these monkeys have the best life they can have. I tried to help them and they took it as an insult At my house By working tirelessly to find a clean alternative A person who made the lives of animals and people better and trying to urge people do the same. No I can bring self confidence and help people how to find it. And I’m 13 and don’t know my bank info. I am neither innocent nor guilty Look at my name bud. Your is a possessive term. As in “Your phone”. You’re is used to describe someone. As in “You’re funny”. I don’t plans to have any career in gaming My internet was faulty Because I am an average human being who just want the world and you to be the best you can be I have a dairy allergy and anytime I have it the result is not great I have a dairy allergy and anytime I have it the result is not great. Actually yes. I’m sure at some point that has happened to me I can sing and I’m a decent artist and writer These allegations are false I did not expect this to blow up. I did this post for the sole purpose of curiosity and boredom. And you upvote because I believe that your I am opening myself up to the Reddit community and that takes guts. Do the best I can to protect me and my family and friends. I neither am guilty or innocent Next question I was bored and was curious what people would come up with Yes 4727472649174 I’m doing half and half and I believe that is a perfect balance to It’s new to my Reddit experience and I’m very excited about it. Black cow give white milk still. And in five years I see myself studying abroad I guess so I cut them both in half then stitched them together. I was bored I’m not obsessed with garlic bread but I do enjoy it October Because I get to make the world a better place in the biggest impact possible I like being interviewed How do you know what your scared of until you do it. If you don’t have experience for anything you will go nowhere . No response They got on my nerves I was suicidal at 8. I got the help I need and I have never been happier. No I’m 13 No *Lady* I think I’m a decent chef Stuff Actually I’m a polar bear Alright, how do you respond to allegations that you murdered a spider in cold blood? Those are an endangered species! YTA. That mosquito had a wife and kids. ^/s Interesting That\\'s wonderful that you want to be a role model to the countless of Redditors out there. What do you say to the naysays who say you\\'re so far away from reaching subs like r/CenturyClub/ that you are in no position to be an aspiration just yet? > I want this karma so that when people look at my cunt they had something to aspire to Brilliant. I\\'m going to forward this answer to my FAQS. I like the way you think. If according to you water isn’t dry, then how can other liquids like wine be considered dry? I\\'m glad for you! Stay strong! Don\\'t mean to sound ignorant, but does an 8 year old feel suicidal. I don\\'t think I even understood why people killed themselves at that age. I definitely get it now, I\\'ve had some trouble with depression(and I still do),but I don\\'t think at 8 I had to mental capacity to even process the thought of killing myself. Relating to my own experience, I also congratulate you on your strength! hello everyone, welcome our new CEO Excuse me?  Did you say you SAT on a BABY? Here’s the new POTUS The Claims Could you expand on that? Off-topic but your thoughts on ‘Love on a Spectrum’? It was just a question, I wasn\\'t offering anything. Your report says you are a \"DIY Proctologist\". Care to explain? Hmmm....very impressive but sadly you didnt list \"honesty\" in the skills section, you only listed your twitter handle. Oh ok. No sorry it is true they are doin your mum doin doin your mum Oh, I\\'m so sorry for the misunderstanding! I thought I was interviewing Fred Teeven... You should a politician, getting out of an answer like that Welp due to work policy ill give u mine. I was in year 6. Aged 11-12. Me and my friends were chilling in the gazebo while the boys play fight. Then,one gets pushed and lands right in my lap. The whole class lost their shit. You’re hired!  When can you start? Are you Joe Exotic\\'s daughter? Are you sure about that? We found your DNA all over the crime scene What what the first subreddit you joined? Good good. You will be hearing from us soon. Sorry lmao didnt see your username Okay good Fair enough ooof i didn\\'t even read into the comments to find out how old you were this is extremely awkward and i should add that it was extreme shock value satire, not an actual suggestion.  i apologize for being crude lol That was very interviewy ok, thats all, i know i said a few but here at abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz we are unprofessional, i failed 3rd grade twice. thank you for your time and welcome abord You may pass I see That\\'s standard for the winning team. Moving on, outside of the corporate water balloon fights, what qualities or strengths do you feel that you could bring to our company? No, you took a lot of time to answer that and I\\'m going to have to press you for a more detailed answer. That\\'s my duty as a reporter. Thank you your hired Logan Saylors https://www.facebook.com/logan.saylors.372 And for what reason? Was it justified? it\\'s even worse than i thought!! You’re hired. Thank you, I really didn\\'t expect for you to get ny reference Congratulations, you were being interviewed by a r/fuckwasps representative. You will be contacted soon Ha lol that’s what I said. No, not that, why’d you do it? Are you avoiding the question the question was how did you feel about those claims and are they true So you refuse to disclose any information regarding your involvement in the run of hate crimes against the Romani people of Northern Italy and Slovenia? Sorry Ma\\'am, my use of Sir was incorrect, as was your use of Your. Oh, sorry, your microphone was muted. What did you say again? Why October? Interesting, what is your stance on the abuse of teapots? Yes, yes. Thank you. *wave* If you answer me I’ll give you a cola I pledge as innocent. Spiders a beautiful addition to the Earth. That\\'s not interviewing per se, that\\'s questioning, do better I wish Everyone liked that What’s century club? Because it\\'s not water, there\\'s alcohol and stuff in wine. \\nStoopyman Thanks Username checks out I understand your point of view, but I also had suicidal thoughts that started when I was pretty young. Suicide can seem like an easy way out, especially when you\\'re young. In OP\\'s case, I think it was because of medicine,  for me it was an unhealthy situation at home. Children are capable of understanding much more than we give them credit for sometimes, but you can\\'t understand something that you\\'ve never encountered before. \\n\\nI can\\'t speak for you but if you\\'ve had a happy childhood without worries, then understanding suicide would be pretty hard. The opposite is also true, if you\\'ve always been sad, then it may be hard to learn how to be happy,  or how to stay happy. That\\'s what I\\'m struggling with mostly. I thought the elections weren’t until November? If you’re going to use 2 staples, just use one I hope he did, because if not then he isn’t qualified All hail the claims! We are I guess you could say wired differently so we have a different point of view on things Well I don’t want any from anyone I’m sorry but you must have someone else report. Could I see if please? Oh well Nope. It’s ok I had really bad connection and I’m taking time to get to every question. But sure go ahed Did you not see my name lol Because I wanted to I misunderstood. I did not have any contact with him, the allegations are false The FBI has forbidden me to disclose anything I’m so sorry I agree and feel we need to switch to unbreakable options I agree What about in hot blood? Probably redditors who have over 1 million karma. I hope OP can concur Who, mine? If I may expand on that. As an autistic person, I feel like everyone is standing in one corner from the room and I\\'m standing in the other corner. Everyone is still looking at the same room but I\\'m just looking from a different angle. That\\'s why I may miss some details normal people would immediately see, but I\\'m also able to notice things others wouldn\\'t normally see. It allows a fresh point of view to both parties when talked about. What examples can you give regarding your creativity? Want some \"coffee\" Well marvellady24, under claims like this you are in no position to make demands. (apologies, I wasn\\'t trying to be pushy or rude, I just wanted to play a pompous interviewer. Sorry if that irked you) That’s not a valid reason to Do you have any proof of this Coward Username checks out Your asking the real questions here 100K Yeah As someone also Autistic, in my case having a photographic memory helps me draw more accurately No I’m good I do not make demands but am simply suggesting that you look at my profile and be the judge. You don’t want to then you don’t have to. No problem No I mean, I am pretty stupid and my name is definitely Yaas... so I guess? as someone who is also autistic I can\\'t draw for shit So am I I’m looking at your profile with vivid pictures of you \"checking up\" your patients, you sicko. Then how can I trust this claim Smooth Well that was wierd Cha-Cha I was asked a couple times about what my alters are like. Rather than copy and paste this to each person, I’m posting as an individual comment. This is my list of alters I’ve had on my phone for a while. Mostly because there’s 14. Too many to track by myself bahaha. I hope y’all enjoy 😌\\n\\n\\nKiana - 13. Boy crazy. Crushes on people easily. Hates most of my friends (guys) until they “prove themselves.” Obsessed with JB and 1D and most pop and some alt. Likes to pretend to be me. Skylars little sister. \\n\\nAmy - 4. Maya’s older sister. Duckie is her stuffed animal. Dino nuggets, apple juice, ice cream, and cuddles are the way to make her shut up and love you. Calls my boyfriends Daddy because she sees them as literal father figures. \\n\\nMaya - 3. Amy’s younger sister. Has a stutter so she is insecure. Doesn’t like to come out because of it. Has Amy speak for her. Same interests as Amy and acts similar to her. Also calls boyfriends Daddy and believes they are literal father figures.\\n\\nElyza - 19. Tracer. Lesbian. Brilliant. Does most of my school work for me. English. Quiet and reserved. Will not speak unless she trusts you.\\n\\nMidnight - 16. Believes she is a demon. Supposedly has a brother named Kevin who is inside another person. Protective. Dangerous. Used to harm me. Doesn’t trust anyone. Usually angry. Comes out if I get too pissed and depressed. \\n\\nBlaike - 36. Also believes he is a demon. Very over protective. Threatens those around me. Does not trust anyone except me and other alters. Takes care of Amy and Maya sometimes. \\n\\nRemmie - 25. Again, believes he is a demon. Doesn’t come out. Likes hiding. No real information known about him.\\n\\nJax - 20. Never. Allowed. Out. Evil. Bisexual. Male version of Skylar. Asher’s (Ash) older brother. Has hurt Amy, Maya, Kiana, and assumably his brother.\\n\\nSkylar - 21. Kianas older sister. Pansexual. Very sexual. Nymph. Likes to try to pretend being me. Has tried to ruin my relationships by attempting to “cheat” on partners. Never allowed to come out.\\n\\nAsh - 14. Jax’s little brother.

Will usually come out when I’m doing any of the above. Other than that, never. \\n\\nAlex - 27. Annoying. Southern. Conservative. Never out because he knows my friends will hate him and he gets annoyed from debate. \\n\\nGiggles - Unknown age and gender. Never allowed out. When they come out they just giggle and rock back and forth. Try and harm me in doing so.\\n\\nSlash - 18. Pretends to be my deceased friend Ryan. Locked up and never allowed out. Will cut me and harm me, hence where he got his name. Do you know what caused your trauma? One thing I was always curious about but felt it would be insensitive to ask is if your alters can talk to each other? Like can they communicate in any way? How many Alters do you have? How are they different? How are they similar? I\\'m ok with an essay of you(all) are. Thanks for doing this. Can you willingly switch to one of your alters or does it have to be triggered by something? Have you watched The United States of Tara? Do you think it was accurate? when the other alters aren’t fronting, is there like a place they hang out in your head lol I saw you answered a question about the movie Split, what do you think about the character Jane from Doom Patrol if you\\'ve seen the show, do you think it\\'s a more accurate depiction of DID (minus the superpowers obviously) than Split or not?\\n\\nOr do you have an example of a character with DID in a movie or a show or a book you find accurate and interesting? Can you please tell us about your college plans? (Congratulations by the way!!) How do you think your diagnosis will affect your college experience? \\nTable of Questions and Answers. Original answer linked - Please upvote the original questions and answers.\\n***\\n\\nQuestion | Answer | Link\\n---------|----------|----------|\\nDo you know what caused your trauma?|The experience that caused my first split was when I was 5 years old, at least that’s what my therapists and I believe. It’s the first time I really knew the alters were there. It was caused due to an extreme physical attack by my stepdad at the time. My splits (I had multiple) came from physical and sexual abuse I endured as a child and early teen.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7wukq/i_am_diagnosed_with_did_ama/g14oijt/)\\nOne thing I was always curious about but felt it would be insensitive to ask is if your alters can talk to each other? Like can they communicate in any way?|It’s not insensitive at all haha. It’s like a radio station or podcast in the background of my mind. They can definitely communicate, it’s just weird at times. Like when trying to go to bed, and just listening to the toddlers (a 3 and 4 year old, sisters) blabbering about wanting ice cream 😂|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7wukq/i_am_diagnosed_with_did_ama/g14xzoe/)\\nHow many Alters do you have? How are they different? How are they similar? I\\'m ok with an essay of you(all) are. Thanks for doing this.|I have 14 of them. You say you’re okay with an essay? Well, I actually have a list of them written in my phone (cuz there’s too many to keep track lol) so if you want I can copy and paste them in a comment :)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7wukq/i_am_diagnosed_with_did_ama/g156uzy/)\\nCan you willingly switch to one of your alters or does it have to be triggered by something?|Yep! Both actually :)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7wukq/i_am_diagnosed_with_did_ama/g14w1dx/)\\nHave you watched The United States of Tara? Do you think it was accurate?|I’ve actually never heard of that before but I’m gonna check it out. Do you know if it’s available on YouTube or Netflix?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7wukq/i_am_diagnosed_with_did_ama/g14xaxb/)\\nwhen the other alters aren’t fronting, is there like a place they hang out in your head lol|I think of it as like a frat house lmfao it’s like having multiple thoughts all at once just in different voices, or listening to a podcast / radio station. It’s pretty cool but not so fun at times lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7wukq/i_am_diagnosed_with_did_ama/g15azcs/)\\nI saw you answered a question about the movie Split, what do you think about the character Jane from Doom Patrol if you\\'ve seen the show, do you think it\\'s a more accurate depiction of DID (minus the superpowers obviously) than Split or not?  Or do you have an example of a character with DID in a movie or a show or a book you find accurate and interesting?|I’m learning about so many new shows / movies with DID and it and I’m just shook haha. I’ve never seen Doom Patrol actually.  I watched a film in high school about DID in my psych class, and I got to share my experience then too. But the film Eve Black was a somewhat decent portrayal. It was a simple way of showing what it can be like, though not super exaggerated or super minimized. They were close when it comes to “curing” DID. For most, recognizing the trauma or event that caused the split is enough to help control it or even eradicate it by accepting what happened and learning to cope and move on. For some, it’s that, plus medication, plus a shite ton of therapy (my route). Though not everyone diagnosed with it will be cured.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7wukq/i_am_diagnosed_with_did_ama/g15bakg/)\\nCan you please tell us about your college plans? (Congratulations by the way!!) How do you think your diagnosis will affect your college experience?|Sure!! I’m actually moving into my dorm next Monday. I was able to get a medically accommodated single dorm thanks to my therapist.  I’m going to school for early childhood education (already have my AAS, but want my BS), to teach preschool. After that, and I’m all settled and in a public school teaching, I wanna go for my masters in clinical social work and have my own child and adolescent therapy practice :)  I don’t think my alters will be too much of an issue, but they definitely have their moments. I’m thinking being away from most of my triggers and reminders of my trauma will keep me, and some of them, calm and not needing to come out. Although the freedom could also have the opposite effect and end up having them go buck wild 🤣|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7wukq/i_am_diagnosed_with_did_ama/g15bxpr/)\\ndo you have alters? if so, how many?|I do! Many actually. 😅So far there is 14 documented, it’s at the point I have them written down in my phone because it’s hard to keep track lmfao|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7wukq/i_am_diagnosed_with_did_ama/g14jj9a/)\\nWhat is DID?|Oof yeah I should’ve put that in the description lol. Dissociate Identity Disorder, previously (and informally) known as Multiple Personality Disorder.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7wukq/i_am_diagnosed_with_did_ama/g14mm2f/)\\nWhat do you think of the movie split?|Some parts I loved and some parts I HATED with a burning passion. I genuinely loved the fact that they used a lot of true facts (though 2 alters being out at once was a big nono lol). Showing the huge differences in the alters, disability / illness, age, gender. It was amazing to finally see that on a big screen yknow? But the whole physically growing taller and more muscular and climbing walls and just flat out supernatural stuff, kidnapping teen girls and killing/eating them.... yeaaahhhh that had me pissed lol.

What’s your favorite personality Do you think that Split (the movie) is an accurate representation of DID (leaving the Beast aside)? \\n\\n[Very ignorant question, sorry, I\\'m just very curious]\\n\\nDo your friends know you have DID? do you think i could ask some of your alters something? if not, how scary is it to walk around in public? This mau sound dumb but how do u know that u arent the alter personality and that one of them is tge real person, also can u ask them questions? What do mean? What did you do? Finish the title The experience that caused my first split was when I was 5 years old, at least that’s what my therapists and I believe. It’s the first time I really knew the alters were there. It was caused due to an extreme physical attack by my stepdad at the time. My splits (I had multiple) came from physical and sexual abuse I endured as a child and early teen. It’s not insensitive at all haha. It’s like a radio station or podcast in the background of my mind. They can definitely communicate, it’s just weird at times. Like when trying to go to bed, and just listening to the toddlers (a 3 and 4 year old, sisters) blabbering about wanting ice cream 😂 I have 14 of them. You say you’re okay with an essay? Well, I actually have a list of them written in my phone (cuz there’s too many to keep track lol) so if you want I can copy and paste them in a comment :) Yep! Both actually :) I’ve actually never heard of that before but I’m gonna check it out. Do you know if it’s available on YouTube or Netflix? I think of it as like a frat house lmfao it’s like having multiple thoughts all at once just in different voices, or listening to a podcast / radio station. It’s pretty cool but not so fun at times lol I’m learning about so many new shows / movies with DID and it and I’m just shook haha. I’ve never seen Doom Patrol actually. \\n\\nI watched a film in high school about DID in my psych class, and I got to share my experience then too. But the film Eve Black was a somewhat decent portrayal. It was a simple way of showing what it can be like, though not super exaggerated or super minimized. They were close when it comes to “curing” DID. For most, recognizing the trauma or event that caused the split is enough to help control it or even eradicate it by accepting what happened and learning to cope and move on. For some, it’s that, plus medication, plus a shite ton of therapy (my route). Though not everyone diagnosed with it will be cured. Sure!! I’m actually moving into my dorm next Monday. I was able to get a medically accommodated single dorm thanks to my therapist. \\n\\nI’m going to school for early childhood education (already have my AAS, but want my BS), to teach preschool. After that, and I’m all settled and in a public school teaching, I wanna go for my masters in clinical social work and have my own child and adolescent therapy practice :)\\n\\nI don’t think my alters will be too much of an issue, but they definitely have their moments. I’m thinking being away from most of my triggers and reminders of my trauma will keep me, and some of them, calm and not needing to come out. Although the freedom could also have the opposite effect and end up having them go buck wild 🤣 I do! Many actually. 😅So far there is 14 documented, it’s at the point I have them written down in my phone because it’s hard to keep track lmfao Oof yeah I should’ve put that in the description lol. Dissociate Identity Disorder, previously (and informally) known as Multiple Personality Disorder. Some parts I loved and some parts I HATED with a burning passion. I genuinely loved the fact that they used a lot of true facts (though 2 alters being out at once was a big nono lol). Showing the huge differences in the alters, disability / illness, age, gender. It was amazing to finally see that on a big screen yknow? But the whole physically growing taller and more muscular and climbing walls and just flat out supernatural stuff, kidnapping teen girls and killing/eating them.... yeaaahhhh that had me pissed lol. The big thing that got me was portraying it like this horrible thing that causes people to be criminals. It’s already a huge stereotype. But I mean. It’s fiction, so.

Thanks for sharing so openly. I’m sorry people are shitty.  Is your situation safer now? By all means, if you\\'re willing. Im sure I\\'m not the only one who\\'s curiosity has been piqued. Can you make one of your alters respond to this? I think it would be funny to see what they have to say... It’s on Hulu or Showtime. It’s really good, it’s about a mom with DID. Brie Larson is in it. that’s really cool! I\\'m so proud of you, and I hope you have a long and fulfilling career 💓 Ahh I’ve heard of that but know nothing about it.. if you wouldn’t mind, could you explain it to me like I’m five? Do your personalities ever directly communicate with another? Yes pleaseee!! Wow this is amazing. So you say you were diagnosed at 6 right? What happened that made your parents take you to therapy? Did they give you a possible cause? Okay so you said jax hurt other personalities, how did he do that. Sorry if this is a sensitive issue.\\n\\nOn another note do dogs act differently around your personalities, this question is based on that sometimes dogs are more protective/lenient towards different peopls Thank you. Honestly it wasn’t for a while, but I’ve actually been living with my best friend since March and I’m moving into a dorm at my college next week for my bachelors :) definitely better than I ever imagined. Haha definitely not. I posted the comment :) Thank you so much 🥺❤️ Sure thing, and like your 10 too? 😉\\n\\nFor starters, it is extremely rare to be diagnosed with and has caused controversy in the psychology field. That’s the main thing people know lol. \\n\\nIt’s almost like having different people living in your head. Think like a frat house of sorts. A buuunch of people all just living their lives, just sharing a brain / body. It’s caused by severe traumatic events, which makes the personalities “split” into different parts. For me, it started with 4 new personalities. \\n\\nThere’s always at least one known as the tracer, which is the equivalent of Pam the secretary extraordinaire. They keep track of how many there are, and who they are. Sometimes the tracer knows of more than the host (the main personality aka me).\\n\\nEach alter can take “control” at any time, though many times they are triggered by certain things. For example, when my anger reaches a certain level, one of my alters takes over because she the more violent one and likes anger. Though nowadays she comes out as a way to calm me. There are very, very few cases of two alters being out at once and it’s believed to be impossible. \\n\\nLastly, the most interesting part, alters can have completely different medical issues. I have autism, asthma, a plethora of issues. None of my alters are autistic, two have asthma, and most are neurotypical. They also all look completely different, at least in my head. \\n\\nI apologize for the essay, I tried to be as detailed as possible while also not boring you 😅 It’s hard to explain, but kinda? But just in my own head. It’s like I’m talking to myself, and listening to a radio station / podcast at the same time. It’s freaky at times 😅 Just posted it ☺️ They weren’t too keen on bringing me. They were abusing me, and my first split was caused by my stepfather. They were forced to bring me to a child psychologist because I was showing major signs of depression, talking about my alters (didn’t know what it was at the time) and other things. The school told that if I wasn’t brought to a specialist to be tested and receive diagnoses for my behaviors then they would have to contact CPS. I stopped opening up the person because of fear, but I don’t really figure out the cause of the first split until later I’m life, when I was about 12 years old. It’s hard to explain really, but through a LOT of manipulation. Basically tricking them into doing things when they come out, and scarring them. Also putting them into situations of physical and sexual trauma (him being out, provoking my parents or abusers, and then making them come out to endure the aftermath). \\n\\nAlso, surprisingly yes! It’s pretty cool haha brothers dog (lived with us for a while) plus the ones I grew up with got used to the majority of them, but certain ones absolutely terrified them and pissed them off. It was scary sometimes coming out and seeing my dogs growling at me, only to then jump on me and lick the hell out of my face and cuddle. That’s awesome! You deserve a good life. Wow! Not boring at all, thanks!! I am so sorry that happened to you, I really hope you are doing much better. I am also sorry I made you remember that. Do you feel better now? Aw it’s totally okay, you don’t need to apologize :) I do feel a LOT better than I used to. I’m moving into my dorm at college next week and I’ll be away from all of stressors, and I am ecstatic haha Looollll I\\'m moving Monday too Haha aye Monday moving club 😎😂 How has this affected her throughout her life? How did she feel when she realized she was in danger? how do you feel about flashing images with no warning? It’s really stupid, but as I have seen, most people who don’t give warning just aren’t educated on photosensitivity. EDIT: I have a strong tolerance for that stuff so I guess count me lucky. yeah, i agree. im not epileptic, but i tend to feel a bit sick if i stare for too long and its just overall not a good feeling to me, i cant imagine how hard it must be if some people go into seizures that could possibly kill them I would ask if y’all are hiring but my lady might see this. \\n\\nYou said worked, so what do you do now? Do you keep in touch with their children since they are technically yours? sounds good and bad at the same time Do you regret it? TIL \"natural inseminator\" is a job title. Was it mostly single women? Were there any couples? Was it weird? I have a lot of questions What\\'s the weirdest scenario in which you had to reveal your job title? Eg tax audit, first date etc. Was the sex just business or did you have fun with it? I don\\'t like your former job, it means you hurt women in a legal way to me. Especially when you say they are willing to leave their partner for you. How did you make sure none of your clients would ask for child support? Did you have them sign a contract? I\\'m in an entirely unrelated field now.\\n\\nI really just saw it as an easy way to make money and pay off student loans. I had the right qualifications—appearance, health profile, academic record—to be a desirable donor, and the pay was very, very good. Yep. It depended a lot on my current client. I don’t, at all. Many were couples.\\n\\nIt was only as weird as the client(s) felt about it. Part of my job was easing them into it. Ha, dating problems were actually why I quit.\\n\\nI’m a good-looking guy and hookups were easy to come by (except when I had to “save up” for work) but it’s pretty much a nonstarter in terms of a relationship with 99% of women. It was satisfying pretty much no matter what. Sometimes it was also a lot of fun. I was providing a service. I wasn’t in control their feelings, nor did I ever lead them on. Yes, that was all handled by an agency. what was your worst client? Huh, that\\'s interesting! I presume you were well paid. Was it usually a one time thing or did you have to go multiple times? Did any of your clients wind up having an emotional attachment? Do you think any of the offspring will try to contact you down the line? I can’t share specifics, even in an anonymous context. But my experience with clients depended mostly on their disposition rather than their appearance. Although my favorites were wonderful and very attractive. > I presume you were well paid. \\n\\nVery.\\n\\n> Was it usually a one time thing or did you have to go multiple times? \\n\\nIt depended on whether it worked. It often took multiple sessions.\\n\\n> Did any of your clients wind up having an emotional attachment?\\n\\nOh, definitely. More than one even signaled that she would leave her partner for me. It was something I had to be very careful about.\\n\\n> Do you think any of the offspring will try to contact you down the line?\\n\\nIt wasn’t something I thought about much at the time, but it seems inevitable some will. Not a question, but I\\'m proud of you and I am sure you are an inspiration to many people at your school even if you don\\'t know it yet :) That\\'s very brave of you. What made you decide to come out? Thank you so much! This makes me so happy. :) Thank you! A lot of people are homophobic in my town, so it was hard, but it paid off. I realized that a lot of people in my town weren\\'t open about gay rights. Only place I felt home at was the skatepark, I used to wear rainbow croptops and no one cared. I\\'ve always been into fashion and I wanted to embrace that at school, but a lot of hate would come with that. It was very tense, but I decided to walk into my school one-day wearing a pride shirt that I made. I was questioned by a lot of people about it and I gave them the response. \"I\\'m gay.\" A lot of the females accepted me, but the boys would judge me in the locker room and never felt good having me in there with them. I wouldn\\'t even look at them, I stood in my old path and hung out with the couple of guy friends who didn\\'t care about how I felt. Welcome to small town USA, right? Lol That’s awesome! I’m glad you had some good friends but I’m really sorry people were mean to you. It makes sense that you’d want to be able to express yourself better now Haha. I guess so. I try not to let it get to me. Even outside of school you have to stay positive. Hate happens to everyone no matter who they are. Same bro.  \\n\\n\\nQuestion: A frog rides a unicycle.

I relate a lot to parts of this, and I’m really glad the internet was a different place when I was younger. I’m glad you’re in a better space now, and wish you the best. As for a question: are you a picky eater? Mentally I’ve improved a lot. Still have a long way to go.\\nI’m literally just a ordinary guy. A man although I still feel like a young boy most of the time honestly Thank you! I used to be incredibly picky much less so now. But it depends some days I’m open to trying anything but sometimes if I get a weird idea about a food it’s hard for me to try it. Most things I do try I eat tho! How are you feeling? What did you do with the hair? I would like to see you now. What caused the breakdown? I’m gonna get some coffee. You want coffee? *Slams images of recently upvoted posts on the table* a solid amount of memes here I can see, primarily from r/memes, a few from pewdiepie submissions, and my partner here managed to find a few from markiplier subreddit......now with evidence like this, we could close this case in seconds with a good jury and put you away as a normie for a long....long time. Unless you confess and spill the beans. Maybe then we could cut a deal. Now tell us, what was the dankest meme so far this year!? I reccomend you tell us quickly, my partner doesnt care much for normies who use r/memes much, and I can only hold him back for so long. What’s your favorite tv show? You can tell me this stays between us. Where were you at 3:00 PM 8/10/2020? *takes out baseball bat* how many children are in the basement I\\'d love some, actually. Honestly, I don\\'t really have a favorite TV show. I barely watch TV at all. CUT TO THE CHASE, WHERE DID YOU STASH THE COCAINE?! Are you sure you wanna stick with that answer? Uh...yeah? You don’t sound very sure...idk if that’ll hold up in court. No...I mean, yes, I mean...fine, I love 90-day Fiance, alright! You got me! And I\\'d frickin watch it again, ya hear me! That’s what I thought, it’s always 90-day Fiance. What classes did you have with him? Did you fight him can you show us the yearbook picture What was the worst he got embarrassed at school? Math and animal science I jerked ricegum off The football team jerked him off Wtf What’s the story behind that?? How do you feel that Holocaust denial is illegal? In the US people would get so angry if that was done here. Have you noticed any hostility towards older (war time) generations, due to the younger generations feeling resentful for bearing the brunt of national guilt. Or are the older generations generally respected?  It must have been confusing for children to learn about these atrocities in school and not have it affect their view of grandparents etc.. What is your  favourite german food? Well, the nazi thing is a big deal. How do you feel about the Holocaust? How much racism is prevalent in your part of the country?\\n\\nAre there any Hitler/Nazi sympathisers in your city/country? One prejudice may be German words can be really long and hard to pronounce.\\n\\nWhat is your favorite type of sausages? I always want to try liver sausages. Wht do you think of Denmark Does it bother you Germany gets so much hate for WW2 but Japan doesn’t even though they did stuff equal or even worse than the Germans? Do you think the output from the mass immigration in Germany justify the input? Do you hate Americans? Has your family been affected by the separation of the two Germanies? Der, die oder das Nutella What would be your advice for an english speaker learning german? Dude, I just approved an idea of genocide and racism on China yesterday. I really hate China. And I started to understand what genocide means. But in my case, China is more of a Godless culture, which has never been through all those conflicts about religion. Don\\'t get me wrong, you westerns has been through Christianity, even if a majority of people don\\'t believe Jesus Christ anymore. I don\\'t oppose Atheists. What I saying here is you will find it hard to believe that some of common values you think it is right, but China think the opposite is right. For example, you think academic freedom is right, one should be critical, one should be reflective, and China think one should be submissive, and when one hold authority, one should oppress others to make them to be submissive to authority figure. This race, this culture specifically, is evil. I am one of them in race, I am Taiwanese, but I just don\\'t agree with such evilness. I mean, you westerns will know such actions are wrong, you may do it, yet you may feel guilty, and you may feel ashamed of it. China won\\'t feel ashamed of it, China think it is how the world functions itself, all those injustice, they think it is justice, or they simply don\\'t have a so called idea of justice because their history is Godless. They submit to authority figure to survive, they never know the meaning of freedom. I don’t, Germany atoned for its past, unlike Japan, Austria or Italy.\\n\\nThe return of antisemitism and the rise of AfD are quite scary, though, I thought those demons had been laid to rest. What’s your take? I\\'m french (from Alsace, hi neighbour)\\nCan you tell me why I can\\'t say more than two sentences in a row in German after learning it for almost 8 years ? I’m ashkenazic jewish and my family is still very scared of German people and inventions. Any words of reassurance ? Did you notice any changes since germany accepted a shit-ton of islamic immigrants? I don\\'t know what to feel. I think that\\'s okay, it\\'s actually illegal to do Hitler salute, to show the Hakenkreuz and other related things are illegal too. \\nIt has its reasons. even if it restricts freedom of expression.  but to deny the Holocaust would be a lie.  forbidding a lie is okay. Why would people in the US get angry if Holocaust denial was made illegal? I get that there are Holocaust deniers in the US but it’s a very small percentage right? Great question! Mettbrötchen that\\'s raw pork meat with raw onions on a bun. Still sad. There is a lot of national guilt. We have a lot of memorials and we learn a lot about it in school. We watch original films or were scenes are recreated (people die in that films) we visit Auschwitz. \\nI was in primary school as I learned that the Nazis killed hundreds of Jews, homosexuals and people with disabilities in gas showers. I\\'m guilty about it, even though I had nothing to do with it. It\\'s still our past! Sadly yes, we still have idiots like every other nation. And sadly I seen some in my city doing the Hitler greeting (it\\'s illegal in Germany) but I think that\\'s a minority a lot of people are against them. We do our best! I love liver sausages but my favorite is Mettwurst and Currywurst. But I hate Weißwurst. As a person I love Denmark because a part of my family comes from there or still live there.\\nAs a German nice little country with nice beaches and humans still kinda sorry what we did in ww2 to you! No, most Germans think that the hate we get is reasonable. And whatever Japan gets is none of our business What do you mean justify the input? \\nDo you mean what money and space we put into justify the things we got out? \\n\\nYes! We helped humans, it was all worth it! \\nBut I don\\'t speak for all Germans some say the same some don\\'t think so and the most are neutral! No we hate Trump and sometimes we think you\\'re kinda idiotic. \\n\\nBut you are more like the big brother who does drugs, sometimes is in jail, loves sports and bad beer. But you like this brother, because he\\'s extreme cool! My great grandfather fled the DDR (the one ruled by Udssr Russia) to the BRD the other side, the free side. He had never seen his family again, but he met my great grandmother and they fell in love built a new one. \\nHe never talked about his time in the war and later. Actually for a few years it went great but sadly there was an accident in colone (Köln) were men sexual harrassed a lot of womens. Even though that the most men were German people said that this were the immigrants. \\nAfter that a lot of people weren\\'t that Welcoming anymore. I don\\'t think that the immigrants brought any negative change. I just think there are a few assh*les in 100 Germans and a few assh*les in 100 immigrants. The rest are cool! Thanks for answering They’d still be angry. Freedom of speech. How can you eat raw pork? Is it cured? Is it smoked? Ooooh yeah! That\\'s the right way, fellow German! You are not guilty, don’t blame yourself for something you have nothing to do with! Woah it\\'s illegal in Germany? Thats a cool fact. These sound delicious, let me do some googling. XD My son (UK) absolutely loves Currywurst, he’s managed to obtain the sauce from the German Deli shop in Borough Market, London. I agree that Weißwurst is foul. We all love going to the Christmas markets but aren’t sure if they’ll be running this year. I appreciate your response, thanks Is it true that most Germans think Americans are moronic, fat, and beer drinking racists? I\\'m so sorry to hear that bro Definitely. I do not deny the Holocaust, but I still think people should be able to for freedom of speech. Lying is still speech. No it\\'s raw fresh meat. You need to consume it on the day you eat it. It\\'s so \"clean\" That it\\'s not a problem. And then it\\'s shredded to Minced meat what you can eat it. I don\\'t blame me, I\\'m still feel guilty. it\\'s our past we need to acknowledge it and it\\'s our job to prevent that it happens again! No we just think you are ruled by one. \\n\\nWe think that some of Americans are that way but the majority is \"normal\". \\nI met enough people and seen people on TV that were the most loving and accepting persons! \\nMore Germans think you\\'re like in High School musical. It\\'s a story, a lot of people have similar ones. It was a tuff time then. But I\\'m happy that Germany is no longer separated! If everyone had to acknowledge and apologise for their past we would be going for ever... time to focus on the future. You have NOTHING to do with the actions of some idiots in the past. You can say it happened but is is not onto you to act like you are at fault for it and somehow need to apologise. You know it\\'s what they teach us. \\nDon\\'t be a nationlist. \\nDon\\'t be a patriot. \\nDon\\'t show your flag. \\nBe sorry for the victims. \\nShow respect. \\nDon\\'t call a dark skinned person black because it could be an insult. \\nDon\\'t brag about anything German\\nBecause if you do you get called a nazi! That’s stupid! I am proud of Germany. There I said it! You guys have amazing quality stuff and have added a lot of technology to the planet. I can be proud of all the great things Germany did, like all the great cars and the new dual fluid reactor design! Oh that\\'s nice to hear, I\\'m proud of those things too but I never say or show it because it\\'s easy to get called nazi here! are you a good witch or a bad witch? What sort of spells do you know?

What vehicle do you own? How much dick did you suck to get that position Has the current pandemic affected your business? Sounds great! How did you land the job? Owned a Maserati Ghibli. Worst car I ever bought, sold it on after 11 months of ownership. Do you whole heartedly believe they are worth the premium? Also owned a 911 and that was a great car Among Alfa Romeo\\'s, what is the most common part that seems to require replacement? I\\'m sort of thinking about getting a 4C in the future as a dream car, but I haven\\'t heard too many praises in terms of reliability.   \\n\\n\\n*Then again some people refuse to change their oil, power steering fluid, or get a transmission flush.. so.. I\\'m not sure if what they claim is 100% true.* 2015 Ram Rebel It\\'s actually not really something I was seeking out...sooooo none I suppose Yes and no. I\\'ve been doing this for over five years now and I live in the midwest, so due to weather, summer is our busiest time of the year. In past summers I think we\\'ve been a little busier, but overall these people still have money and want to play with their toys, so they\\'ll pay to play, and we\\'re still in the positive fortunately. So when entering college I was looking for a part-time gig and found one as a parts delivery driver for the company. Had an incredible manager who saw something in me and was promoted to counter associate. Roughly a year later I was asked to take over the Porsche brand, and the year following came Maserati and Alfa. Lololol! I\\'m sorry to hear that, however, I completely agree in regards to a Maserati. Most of them are POS in my opinion, and they lose their value faster than any car in production. \\n\\nOut of the one\\'s I oversee, Porsche is certainly my favorite and I enjoy them as vehicles. 911\\'s are awesome, and Porsche as a brand really has it figured out. As to answer if they\\'re worth it, Maserati\\'s are not at all. If you\\'ve got the money for a Porsche, then go for it! I\\'d certainly like to own one someday if the price was right. Lol! I\\'m someone who is a big believer in preventative maintenance, so for those that don\\'t take care of their car, well, you get what you put in. Mopar owns Alfa, so from a maintenance perspective their a *little* pricy, however out of all the ones I touch, certainly the most affordable.\\n\\nAlfa\\'s are very interesting to me because they made their US comeback in 2017, and most of them are still covered under warranty. The biggest problem I\\'m seeing on them right now is probably the engine radiator on the Stelvio\\'s leak frequently, however, right now it\\'s covered under warranty so.\\n\\nAs for the 4C itself, that\\'s tough as I\\'ve never actually driven one. I hear they\\'re a ton of fun to track, but if you\\'re doing ANYTHING else in them, it blows. I\\'ve sat in them and they\\'re extremely uncomfortable, and I\\'ve heard their suspension is incredibly stiff. Price point wise, I think you get a better bang for your buck in the Cayman, however, that\\'s subjective to what you\\'re looking for too. Nice! :) Quite impressive, good luck with your job :)) Thanks for getting back to me. The Ghibli was a 340i in a silk blouse in my opinion. The interior was just off, the infotainment system was appalling and it wasn’t particularly reliable.\\n\\nThe 911 I owned was a 2012 model and I loved it. Really was a super car for everyday. Needed something bigger so sold it. Currently drive a Q7, very boring and have ordered an X7, started to think I should’ve got the new Cayenne. Porsche in the U.K. depreciates fast though, especially Cayenne’s. Thank you! Yours too future Mr/Ms President Yeah, I\\'m just out on Maserati\\'s. The only thing they have is their exhaust and the trident, however, it just doesn\\'t seem worth the money.\\n\\nThe new Cayenne\\'s are beautiful IMO, and I think they\\'re pretty stellar. Cayenne\\'s are easily our quickest depreciator as well, however between those and Macan\\'s, are our best sellers due to living in the midwest with the weather. seems you where in \"the empire business\" Welcome :D Why have you never used social media before?? this ama is invalid, you have used social media now. I\\'ve never had access to it It seems really cool so i\\'m disappointed i haven\\'t used it till now That’s nice, reddit has a reputation of being a super shitty and toxic site so it’s kinda a weird place to start. if this is your first time here I recommend you stick to hobby or meme related subreddits, anything to do with politics is incredibly cancerous.\\n\\nI’m curious, why didn’t you have access to Social media until now? I started on vk and found it fun so looked for other sites. Do you suggest any subreddits? I havent had the money to buy phone or anything so i couldnt use these r/PublicFreakout and r/DataIsBeautiful are both rather interesting in different ways. I also like \\nr/OkBuddyRetard however most of the humour there is extremely obscure and likely wouldn’t make sense to someone unfamiliar with “reddit culture”. There’s a subreddit for pretty much every hobby out there, hobby related subreddits are usually the most friendly. r/CasualConversation is also a nice place.\\n\\nOverall it doesn’t really matter what subreddit you go on as long as you actively avoid politics, you’ll be consumed by a/the hivemined very quickly after you spend too much time in r/Politics or r/Conservative Thanks (: It doesn\\'t seem toxic here. Theres alot of kind people like you I also do this. Are we special? Can I learn this power? I want proof Can I harness your power? Yes You can but its extremly hard I dont run out of the room when i turn the lights off and i can bite icecream with my front teeth Wow man, so you\\'re telling the truth Yup But how tho ? My secret is not running when i turn the lights off and biting icecream with my front teeth How do you resist ? By not running and biting the icecream Does emma uses reddit ? Yes That\\'s what she said I\\'m terrified of rollercoasters..do you get scared and if yes is that the part you like, is that the adrenaline? How high was the highest one and do you go alone or with others? Where do you live? Have you ever been to Cedar Point? If you jerk off on a rollercoaster, will the cum splash into everyone’s face? how many projectile vomits/vomits I used to be scared of any coaster that had an inversion. Until I accidently stepped into one. Now I am never really scared of it.\\n\\nMain part I like about coasters is the feeling of speed and the G-forces that work on you as the train works it\\'s way around the elements.\\n\\nThe tallest one was Red Force and it was about 112m and got launced to 180 km/h to reach the top. \\n\\nSome of them I went with family.

This is a good thing, yea? What’s it called? Depression, bi-polar disorder, and a host of others can cause your issue. Bipolar disorder? Tell me more about it I\\'m not a dr, contact a dr. Okii! HOLY FUCKING SHIT- I- I HAVE ALL THE FUCKING SYMPTOMS OMG WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF Hope it’s just my adhd Have you seen babayoue? Is the White House haunted? If so, by whom and why? What would a ghost be doing? Do you believe in ghosts and spirits? craziest paranormal experience? Sounds cool.\\n\\nDo you like to prank your friends when going to these haunted houses? How do you find or hear about these places? was there any places that was peaceful and calm instead of like scary? Do you film it? Have you been to Winchester house? What was your favorite place you’ve gotten to explore? And what were some of the most interesting “left behind” things you’ve seen? I always think it’s so fascinating to see ordinary items like textbooks in abandoned schools or whatever, just forgotten by whoever left (only seen in pics, never gotten to explore!) Are you religious? If so, do your religious beliefs interact with how you think about the paranormal and life after death? you ever go down in the sewers?   how deep is the deepest sewage you\\'ve stood in? Have you ever found dead animals (other than bugs-) While exploring some of them? I have no idea what that is tbh It is, by an orange with a human shaped body and the mind of a baby. Nobody can understand how it got there I\\'ve honestly never been to the white house so I really couldn\\'t say. ghosting his ex Ghost shit man, Ghost shit. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIn all seriousness I honestly don\\'t know what they do. I believe in ghosts, but I am not sure if I believe in them more in the sense of sentient beings who used to be humans, or some sort of non-sentient being who is just a memory implanted on a place. Yes. If I didn\\'t I wouldn\\'t believe in haunted locations. I\\'ve seen stuff and heard several things. I think one of the creepiest was when I was alone on the third floor of an abandoned asylum. I actually had permission to be there and the person who let me in was long gone. I entered this room that was dark and almost right away heard someone whisper near my ear \"help me\" No. If my friends come with me which is very rare I don\\'t mess around. The one time I was caught and every time I\\'ve almost have been caught have been because of others. Lots of googling and driving back roads. Very occasionally hearing something from another explorer or even civilian. Oh yeah a lot of places are very peaceful. I know an old lockmaster house near a river and its just a great place to sit by the water. Most times yes Most times yes Never been to California. Or generally out west other than New Mexico Mildly and honestly they don\\'t. To me it\\'s two separate world\\'s. Its babayoue, you dont know babayoue? LMAOOOOOOO. THIS RIGHT HERE IS GOLD PEOPLE Do explore by yourself? and what happened after? Had any ghosts appear on camera? Nope and neither does Google lmao. I just get redirected to a band when I Google it. Generally yes. Very rarely I\\'ll take some friends, and some haunted locations only open up for Public hunts. I ran out of that room haha. I had to pass by it several times because of its location, but nothing strange happened there again. No. At one point I thought I caught something but it was a resolution thing tricking me. Have caught voices though. Do the atmosphere of creepy places not scare you? Are these videos available to view? They do but getting to explore places is way more fun than any fear. My YT channel is called travelwithaustin. There\\'s one whole video dedicated to a creepy evp I got at an old prison. Also some from a hospital but those are less clear Have you run into homeless people or thugs living in these abandon places? In what is now probably hundreds of explorations I\\'ve seen two homeless people. One place had evidence of a homeless person but I never saw them Got caught by the police for trespassing? Nope. Only been \"caught\" once and it was by the owners of the place and it wasn\\'t getting caught so much as my friend telling them we were there That\\'s a huge accomplishment!\\n\\nIs it true what they say about the senses of taste and smell being dulled by smoking?

Is it true what they say about the senses of taste and smell being dulled by smoking? Did those senses get stronger again after you quit, and if so what was that like?|It is true, but I\\'ve only felt slight difference if any, really. My senses of smell and taste have always been particularly strong even while I smoked, so I wouldn\\'t say they were being too dulled. During the last couple months before I quit, I couldn\\'t help being almost grossed out by the taste of the smoke, which is what contributed greatly to my decision to quit. I still smoke pot so I guess maybe that\\'s why I don\\'t notice any significant change in my sense of taste.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7p1hv/two_years_ago_i_quit_smoking_cigarettes_ama/g139e7c/)\\nCongratulations! I quit recently too, but now I\\'m vaping :(  Are there any scenarios where it\\'s hard for you to not smoke? (Like when drinking, with friends who smoke, etc)|Nope, not at all. For the first couple of days after quitting, I\\'ve had \"reflex\" thoughts about lighting a cig while sitting at my computer, mainly because that\\'s where I used to smoke the most, while gaming. However, it was just a habit to grab a cig whenever I\\'d finish typing something or when I\\'d complete a game objective or get killed, ie. whenever my hands were \"free\" and whenever I could safely shift my attention away from the screen.  Like I said, this habit was gone after a few days and I\\'ve never had an urge to light, being alone or with friends who smoke. More to the point, the smoke started bothering me and I\\'ve asked all of my friends, most of whom are smokers, to sit by the window while smoking. I now tend to avoid the company of tobacco smokers, especially if there\\'s more of them smoking in group.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7p1hv/two_years_ago_i_quit_smoking_cigarettes_ama/g13cfkp/)\\nNothing to ask, just want to say congrats.|Thanks a lot.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7p1hv/two_years_ago_i_quit_smoking_cigarettes_ama/g136dc4/)\\nHow hard was it to stop?|Very easy, after I realized I\\'m not actually addicted to nicotine but only had a nasty habit. Smoking pot helped me realize this and helped me quit. Every time I\\'d have a joint, I didn\\'t feel the need to have a cig for a couple hours afterwards. So two years ago I just said \"fuck this shit, I\\'m finishing this pack (3 more cigs left) and never lighting a smoke again\", and I did.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7p1hv/two_years_ago_i_quit_smoking_cigarettes_ama/g1364zg/)\\nHow long did you quit previously (you said twice) and whats different this time?|First time I tried quitting by gradually reducing the number of cigs I smoke per day, and it went really slowly, it took me a month to go from one pack to 3-4 cigs a day, but I wasn\\'t very determined about it I guess, so I quickly returned to burning up a whole pack a day.  One year after that, I decided to just cut it down to one, maybe two cigs a day and it worked for a week, but again I wasn\\'t very responsible and, being single with a lot of free time on my hands, I spent hours in front of my screen, which made me smoke more every day, so again I was at a pack a day after only two weeks.  Another year passed and I literally tell myself \"what an idiot you are\" and just quit because I knew I wasn\\'t hooked and didn\\'t wanna allow my irresponsibility to go that far. So basically, the difference between the 1st two times and the last time was just realizing I could have quit for good 1st two times if I wasn\\'t irresponsible.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7p1hv/two_years_ago_i_quit_smoking_cigarettes_ama/g13cooy/)\\nCongratulations man, so many people get lung cancer from smoking so I am glad that you quit.|To be honest, I was well aware of all the risks during these 15 years and it didn\\'t stop me from poisoning myself. I only quit because I was fed up with the nasty taste in my mouth and throat, as well as my fingers awfully stinking, not to mention having to pay for it all.  Thanks a lot!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7p1hv/two_years_ago_i_quit_smoking_cigarettes_ama/g13qlc1/)\\nDamn man I\\'m trying to quit but it\\'s so fucking hard.|Do you have your reasons for quitting defined? If so, what are they?  Also, why do you find it so hard to quit?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7p1hv/two_years_ago_i_quit_smoking_cigarettes_ama/g13xsvy/)\\nI\\'m 6 weeks cigarette free.   Although that Luekmia diagnosis made it easy.  Congratulations 🎉|Thank you!  I\\'m very sorry to hear about your diagnosis, I had a little niece who suffered from leukemia 4 years ago. Hope you\\'ll get better soon!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7p1hv/two_years_ago_i_quit_smoking_cigarettes_ama/g147n7d/)\\nHow did you finally manage to get yourself to quit?|After \"quitting\" twice and starting back again, I basically had a short conversation with myself and decided that I never should have started in the first place, and if I don\\'t quit now, who knows how much more time and money it\\'ll cost me before I do. I was also fed up with the nasty taste in my mouth and throat as well as the nasty smell of my breath and fingers, the stench of smoke getting into everything in my room, etc.  Another reason I forgot to mention was setting an example for all my friends who constantly moan about needing to quit but never do, as well as my mom who smokes more than a pack a day, for over 30 years now, and keeps telling me she \"should quit, but can\\'t make herself to\".|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7p1hv/two_years_ago_i_quit_smoking_cigarettes_ama/g149i41/)\\nDo you ever regret smoking? I currently don’t smoke nor plan to smoke anytime soon (M18) but I want to hear your thoughts on if smoking would be worth trying for the first time, while running the risk of getting addicted to it.|Hell, yes! If I could turn back time, I\\'d literally beat myself for even starting. I was a dumb kid back in the day, when I started high school I had to move into a boarding school. Up until then I was still under control of my parents, but once I was away from home, it was like setting a wild animal free from a cage. I was 15 and influenced by my own ego as well as other people around me. I still remember the first couple of weeks I smoked for the heck of it, a few cigs a day, when offered by my at-the-time friends.

No more coughing out nasty stuff every morning too.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/i7p1hv/two_years_ago_i_quit_smoking_cigarettes_ama/g14gacp/)\\n\\n---\\n[Source] (https://github.com/johnsliao/ama_compiler) It is true, but I\\'ve only felt slight difference if any, really. My senses of smell and taste have always been particularly strong even while I smoked, so I wouldn\\'t say they were being too dulled. During the last couple months before I quit, I couldn\\'t help being almost grossed out by the taste of the smoke, which is what contributed greatly to my decision to quit. I still smoke pot so I guess maybe that\\'s why I don\\'t notice any significant change in my sense of taste. Nope, not at all. For the first couple of days after quitting, I\\'ve had \"reflex\" thoughts about lighting a cig while sitting at my computer, mainly because that\\'s where I used to smoke the most, while gaming. However, it was just a habit to grab a cig whenever I\\'d finish typing something or when I\\'d complete a game objective or get killed, ie. whenever my hands were \"free\" and whenever I could safely shift my attention away from the screen.\\n\\nLike I said, this habit was gone after a few days and I\\'ve never had an urge to light, being alone or with friends who smoke. More to the point, the smoke started bothering me and I\\'ve asked all of my friends, most of whom are smokers, to sit by the window while smoking. I now tend to avoid the company of tobacco smokers, especially if there\\'s more of them smoking in group. Thanks a lot. Same, congrats G. Very easy, after I realized I\\'m not actually addicted to nicotine but only had a nasty habit. Smoking pot helped me realize this and helped me quit. Every time I\\'d have a joint, I didn\\'t feel the need to have a cig for a couple hours afterwards. So two years ago I just said \"fuck this shit, I\\'m finishing this pack (3 more cigs left) and never lighting a smoke again\", and I did. First time I tried quitting by gradually reducing the number of cigs I smoke per day, and it went really slowly, it took me a month to go from one pack to 3-4 cigs a day, but I wasn\\'t very determined about it I guess, so I quickly returned to burning up a whole pack a day.\\n\\nOne year after that, I decided to just cut it down to one, maybe two cigs a day and it worked for a week, but again I wasn\\'t very responsible and, being single with a lot of free time on my hands, I spent hours in front of my screen, which made me smoke more every day, so again I was at a pack a day after only two weeks.\\n\\nAnother year passed and I literally tell myself \"what an idiot you are\" and just quit because I knew I wasn\\'t hooked and didn\\'t wanna allow my irresponsibility to go that far. So basically, the difference between the 1st two times and the last time was just realizing I could have quit for good 1st two times if I wasn\\'t irresponsible. To be honest, I was well aware of all the risks during these 15 years and it didn\\'t stop me from poisoning myself. I only quit because I was fed up with the nasty taste in my mouth and throat, as well as my fingers awfully stinking, not to mention having to pay for it all.\\n\\nThanks a lot! Do you have your reasons for quitting defined? If so, what are they?\\n\\nAlso, why do you find it so hard to quit? Thank you!\\n\\nI\\'m very sorry to hear about your diagnosis, I had a little niece who suffered from leukemia 4 years ago. Hope you\\'ll get better soon! After \"quitting\" twice and starting back again, I basically had a short conversation with myself and decided that I never should have started in the first place, and if I don\\'t quit now, who knows how much more time and money it\\'ll cost me before I do. I was also fed up with the nasty taste in my mouth and throat as well as the nasty smell of my breath and fingers, the stench of smoke getting into everything in my room, etc.\\n\\nAnother reason I forgot to mention was setting an example for all my friends who constantly moan about needing to quit but never do, as well as my mom who smokes more than a pack a day, for over 30 years now, and keeps telling me she \"should quit, but can\\'t make herself to\". Hell, yes! If I could turn back time, I\\'d literally beat myself for even starting. I was a dumb kid back in the day, when I started high school I had to move into a boarding school. Up until then I was still under control of my parents, but once I was away from home, it was like setting a wild animal free from a cage. I was 15 and influenced by my own ego as well as other people around me. I still remember the first couple of weeks I smoked for the heck of it, a few cigs a day, when offered by my at-the-time friends. I didn\\'t like it, I didn\\'t need it, I just thought I\\'d fit in easier, because most people smoked. I wish I knew back then that I would never fit in, which is true.\\n\\nI honestly don\\'t see anything about it that\\'s \"worth\" trying. It\\'s nasty, smells bad, ruins your breath, your fingers stink, your clothes stink, your hair stinks. Nothing good comes from it, not to mention it\\'s literally toxic. The warnings on the packs are not exaggeration - smoking kills and causes not only cancer but other nasty diseases too. It\\'s just a money making scheme for the rich industrialists to get richer by making over a billion consumers world-wide poison themselves willingly. Not even gonna go into what [nicotine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Pesticide) causes.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and experiment with cannabis instead of wasting time, money, and health with tobacco products. I definitely have a higher lung capacity now, but that\\'s about everything I\\'ve noticed that\\'s changed for the better health-wise. No more coughing out nasty stuff every morning too. I don\\'t think it\\'s impossible. Evidently, she\\'s shown she\\'s able to quit. But I don\\'t have any good advice to offer to someone who\\'s already managed to quit for a whole year except \"just do it again\". It\\'s obviously a choice she was once able to make, so I don\\'t see why she wouldn\\'t be able to make it again. From what you\\'ve said, it seems to me she just says she wants to quit but is either not determined enough or doesn\\'t really want to quit.\\nEither way, good luck to both of you. :) Yes. Yeah I get that! That was the hardest part for me, finishing a game and not going outside to light up lol Thank you. Awesome! Thats nice. I saw you mentioned that you were single when you tried quitting. Are you now in a serious relationship? Do you think that played a role in motivating you? Mostly depression and addiction runs in my family. I\\'m tired of coughing and my stamina/health has clearly deteriorated over the last 10 years. I was doing good before the pandemic, maybe 4 cigarettes a day because I can\\'t smoke at work. But being stuck inside all day, hating life and my apartment, I just habitually smoke all day. When I\\'m with the gf I try not to smoke.but then I get irritable after like 8 hours. I hope she is well. The average age of s person with this type is over 70 so the odds are definitely better for me. congrats bro I used to smoke indoors, much worse, the smoke lingers for a while, the smell just gets into everything, it was awful.\\n\\nYou mentioned vaping by the way, I\\'ve had dozens of coworkers switch to vaping last year, it was literally a rage where I work, they were all so proud of themselves for it, going non-stop about how it\\'s less harmful, yadda yadda yadda, even tho they were all basically using cheap crap manufactured in China and paid about $20 or so, with crappy flavors etc. After about two or three months I see them all back to regular tobacco. I was in a relationship until a few days ago. I quit before we started dating, but even if I didn\\'t quit before, I would have quit then since she had asthma and could not stand being in the same room with someone smoking. And yes, dating did play a certain role in my wish to quit because I don\\'t wanna date people who smoke, so I can\\'t imagine why any non-smoker would wanna date me, making out with me would taste like kissing an ashtray. I see. Depression and addiction are not strange to me, even some of my family members are affected by both. Furthermore, where I live most people smoke, so it\\'s a very common occurrence, even for young teens.\\n\\nYou nailed it with \"habitually\" right there. You\\'re just like I used to be, smoking because you\\'re used to and now because you have a lot of free time on your hands. I wouldn\\'t say you\\'re addicted, otherwise you\\'d be struggling every day because your work only allows you to consume 4 cigarettes a day.\\n\\nAll you gotta do is stop buying. Make a goal like I did - finish the pack you\\'ve got on you and tell yourself \"I\\'m finally done with this, fed up with the stench, the awful taste, the coughing, all of it, fuck this nasty shit\".\\n\\nFor a few days whenever you think about lighting up with that thought in the back of your mind telling you that you \"need it\", just counter it by telling yourself \"no I don\\'t, I just think I do\". I\\'m not gonna tell you to regain control over yourself because you already are in control, this isn\\'t an addiction to nicotine, this is a nasty habit you can just kick. Trust me, you\\'ll feel much better without it and everything that comes with it. Plus, you\\'ve got your girlfriend to support you with it, I didn\\'t have much support - all of my friends are heavy smokers. If she\\'s not a smoker, which I\\'m assuming she isn\\'t judging by what you said about trying not to smoke around her, she\\'ll appreciate you more and be proud of you. Sadly, she passed away after a few months of therapy. It was a rare type. She was 7 years old. Thanks! Yeah I\\'ve never been a fan of smoking indoors. And yeah alot of people where I live vape and I started in order to quit cigarettes, but now I\\'m just hooked on another form of nicotine. Hopefully going to quit the vape soon though! I am definitely addicted to nicotine. My mother smoked around me ever since I was born as well as when she was pregnant (drank as well). \\n\\nI agree with you that it\\'s a big mental thing but I\\'m just not right mentally, especially stuck at home. I\\'m looking for a new job because of COVID so hopefully once that happens things will get progressively better. \\n\\nThe thing is when I am with her or doing something that takes my attention, I can easily ignore the cravings as I am distracted or doing something that takes my attention. It\\'s this quarantine that\\'s fucking me right now. \\n\\nAnd drinking ha. That\\'s so not fair.  I\\'m so sorry. Do you feel the need for the nicotine and how would you describe it? I\\'ve never genuinely felt like I had an urge for the stuff, sometimes just lighting the cig would feel as a relief and I wouldn\\'t even finish it. My mom smoked before she had me, then quit when she got pregnant and started smoking again after she stopped breastfeeding me. Dad never stopped smoking. I grew up in a household with them and dad\\'s father smoking, and almost any male relatives or friends that ever came visiting smoked. It was what normalized it for me.\\n\\nI now view it as a trashy thing. I\\'m not an attractive guy, and I\\'d turn down a literal sex bomb only because she\\'s a smoker. A huge NO for me.\\n\\nYou say being distracted and working helps you not smoke. Good. Find more distractions/hobbies. Make sure whatever it is, it helps you from even thinking about lighting up. Also try replacing cigarettes with weed. I don\\'t mean that like replacing one addiction with another, but in my case weed has helped me a lot, since I had no urge to smoke a cig for up to a few hours after smoking a joint. Life isn\\'t fair most of the time. I\\'m sorry she had to go through all that too, as well as her entire family, and countless of others, young or old, who die from unnatural causes.\\n\\nThank you for your sympathy. Hope you kick your cancer in the butt. I have some rage issues so for me it usually feels like I\\'m on the verge of flipping out and I take a few hits and it subsides. I\\'m trying to find a better way to control my anger rather than using a harmful substance. At this point I\\'m not even sure if its helping or if I\\'m so used to smoking when I\\'m mad that my brain thinks \"hey I feel better now\" I smoke a lot of weed as well. The kicker? I love spliffs. If I have weed I won\\'t even smoke a cigarette because I\\'ll smoke a spliff. But it\\'s still consuming tobacco and nicotine so it\\'s more like a bandage on the wound rather than actual treatment. \\n\\nAlso I smoke so much weed costs too damn much haha. I\\'ll burn an ounce in a week or less It may very well be an actual addiction but it may also be just a coping mechanism and taking a few hits has a placebo effect.\\n\\nI\\'ve been hearing all my life that people smoke for stress relief. So naturally, whenever I\\'ve been angered I\\'d light up to calm myself down, but I\\'d never really felt like it helped me. Well, damn bro, an ounce can last me up to a month. You need to cut that down too, lol. We both have somewhat of an addictive personality, but we can\\'t let our addictions dictate our life choices and lifestyles. Again, going to work I can\\'t smoke weed... Everything has gotten higher in consumption since lockdown. I am planning on moving at the end of the month (hopefully) and a change of scenery I think will help my mental stability. Good luck! Hope everything turns out well for ya.'"

something 🎈   hmmmm this one be tuff cause i see a lot of wierd shit   but encounter wise i be move a patient once that be out loudly hit on almost every female -PRON- pass by and the patient even caress the hair of a few doc i try stop -PRON- but move a bed and iv pole with both hand make that very difficult 😬    so yeah that be a very awkwardwierd couple minute   now if -PRON- would have say scarygoreiestsadd that s a different story happy birthday to -PRON- too cheer mate 🍻 🥳 thank -PRON- friend   damn could have be mighty rich right about now 😏 😂 -PRON- have be wait to say this -PRON- entire life   same to -PRON- happy birthday ok tbf the room -PRON- have still a private one be in an overflow area an extension of the er if -PRON- will    so -PRON- be a big area with some private wall off room which -PRON- patient be already assign to   -PRON- do not like the fact that outside of thi room against the wall be other bed and only curtain separate -PRON- believe -PRON- i think the same fucking thing some people can be real picky and -PRON- blow -PRON- mind smh   some of -PRON- icu room have window behind the bed so the patient that be alert can not even see outside consider -PRON- self lucky    seem like everything go well -PRON- be glad -PRON- still here with -PRON- friend 🥳   hahaha naw at this point almost   year do this -PRON- have master the craft many nurse have tell -PRON- how much of a good driver i be fit through tight hallway maneuver around people ect like anything with practice come confidence and -PRON- be very confident in -PRON- handling of the bed   but when there be many iv line and other thing that can be catch and potentially rip off i do take -PRON- time and make sure everything be good before try to get in a tight space   with that be yeah of course -PRON- have bump into thing not at full speed never that but sometimes -PRON- just unavoidable for instance many of -PRON- room entrance give -PRON- a few inch of play to go in with the bed so sometimes i purposely bump the side of the bed a bit on the door frame for leverage to turn the bed when -PRON- be transport solo    the hard thing to move be some of the icuair bed air mattress bed because -PRON- be battery operate -PRON- -PRON- essentially drive -PRON- self but when those fucking bed have no power get ready to move a   lb bed plus whatever the patient weights imagine push a large   wheeled wagon with   with one hand while hold on to an iv pole with the other -PRON- happen to -PRON- but in those case i obviously ask the nurse to help out if -PRON- be transport with -PRON- believe -PRON- i be dumbfound but whatever -PRON- thi life not -PRON- can not force -PRON- to do anything what can -PRON- do 🤷 🏽\\u200d ♂ ️ -PRON- be kid i would never allow that to happen   but if there be something on -PRON- wishlist -PRON-   a new   controller   and an sne classic   lol hey thank -PRON- friend best of luck out thier serve -PRON- be safe and a word of advice from a cousin who

good friend since march and -PRON- be move into a dorm at -PRON- college next week for -PRON- bachelor   definitely well than i ever imagine haha definitely not i post the comment   thank -PRON- so much 🥺 ❤ ️ sure thing and like -PRON-   too 😉   for starter -PRON- be extremely rare to be diagnose with and have cause controversy in the psychology field that s the main thing people know lol    -PRON- almost like have different people live in -PRON- head think like a frat house of sort a buuunch of people all just live -PRON- life just share a brain   body -PRON- cause by severe traumatic event which make the personality split into different part for -PRON- -PRON- start with   new personality    there s always at least one know as the tracer which be the equivalent of pam the secretary extraordinaire -PRON- keep track of how many there be and who -PRON- be sometimes the tracer know of more than the host the main personality aka -PRON-   each alter can take control at any time though many time -PRON- be trigger by certain thing for example when -PRON- anger reach a certain level one of -PRON- alter take over because -PRON- the more violent one and like anger though nowadays -PRON- come out as a way to calm -PRON- there be very very few case of two alter be out at once and -PRON- believe to be impossible    lastly the most interesting part alter can have completely different medical issue i have autism asthma a plethora of issue none of -PRON- alter be autistic two have asthma and most be neurotypical -PRON- also all look completely different at least in -PRON- head    i apologize for the essay i try to be as detailed as possible while also not bore -PRON- 😅 -PRON- hard to explain but kinda but just in -PRON- own head -PRON- like -PRON- be talk to -PRON- and listen to a radio station   podcast at the same time -PRON- freaky at time 😅 just post -PRON- ☺ ️ -PRON- be not too keen on bring -PRON- -PRON- be abuse -PRON- and -PRON- first split be cause by -PRON- stepfather -PRON- be force to bring -PRON- to a child psychologist because i be show major sign of depression talk about -PRON- alter do not know what -PRON- be at the time and other thing the school tell that if i be not bring to a specialist to be test and receive diagnosis for -PRON- behavior then -PRON- would have to contact cps i stop open up the person because of fear but i do not really figure out the cause of the first split until later -PRON- be life when i be about   year old -PRON- hard to explain really but through a lot of manipulation basically trick -PRON- into do thing when -PRON- come out and scar -PRON- also put -PRON- into situation of physical and sexual trauma -PRON- be out provoke -PRON- parent or abuser and then make -PRON- come out to endure the aftermath    also surprisingly yes -PRON- pretty cool haha brother dog live with -PRON- for a while plus the one i grow up with get use to the majority of -PRON- but certain one absolutely terrify -PRON- and piss -PRON- off -PRON- be scary sometimes come out and see -PRON- dog growl at -PRON- only to then jump on -PRON- and lick the hell out of -PRON- face and cuddle that s awesome -PRON- deserve a good life wow not bore at all thank i be so sorry that happen to -PRON- i really hope -PRON- be do much well i be also sorry i make -PRON- remember that do -PRON- feel well now aw -PRON- totally okay -PRON- do

-PRON- really stupid but as i have see most people who do not give warning just be not educate on photosensitivity edit i have a strong tolerance for that stuff so i guess count -PRON- lucky yeah i agree -PRON- be not epileptic but i tend to feel a bit sick if i stare for too long and -PRON- just overall not a good feeling to -PRON- i can not imagine how hard -PRON- must be if some people go into seizure that could possibly kill -PRON- i would ask if -PRON- all be hire but -PRON- lady may see this    -PRON- say work so what do -PRON- do now do -PRON- keep in touch with -PRON- child since -PRON- be technically -PRON- sound good and bad at the same time do -PRON- regret -PRON- til natural inseminator be a job title be -PRON- mostly single woman be there any couple be -PRON- weird i have a lot of question what s the weird scenario in which -PRON- have to reveal -PRON- job title eg tax audit first date etc be the sex just business or do -PRON- have fun with -PRON- i do not like -PRON- former job -PRON- mean -PRON- hurt woman in a legal way to -PRON- especially when -PRON- say -PRON- be willing to leave -PRON- partner for -PRON- how do -PRON- make sure none of -PRON- client would ask for child support do -PRON- have -PRON- sign a contract -PRON- be in an entirely unrelated field now   i really just see -PRON- as an easy way to make money and pay off student loan i have the right qualification — appearance health profile academic record — to be a desirable donor and the pay be very very good yep -PRON- depend a lot on -PRON- current client i do not at all many be couple

-PRON- down the line i can not share specific even in an anonymous context but -PRON- experience with client depend mostly on -PRON- disposition rather than -PRON- appearance although -PRON- favorite be wonderful and very attractive   i presume -PRON- be well pay    very    be -PRON- usually a one time thing or do -PRON- have to go multiple time    -PRON- depend on whether -PRON- work -PRON- often take multiple session    do any of -PRON- client wind up have an emotional attachment   oh definitely more than one even signal that -PRON- would leave -PRON- partner for -PRON- -PRON- be something i have to be very careful about    do -PRON- think any of the offspring will try to contact -PRON- down the line   -PRON- be not something i think about much at the time but -PRON- seem inevitable some

fairly easily     dramatic   break bad if -PRON- do not like this idk what to tell -PRON-   westworld -PRON- a deep meaning type of show so idk    that s all i can think of at the moment     movie can

business sound great how do -PRON- land the job own a maserati ghibli bad car i ever buy sell -PRON- on after   month of ownership do -PRON- whole heartedly believe -PRON- be worth the premium also own a   and that be a great car among alfa romeo what be the most common part that seem to require replacement -PRON- be sort of think about get a   in the future as a dream car but i have not hear too many praise in term of reliability       then again some people refuse to change -PRON- oil power steering fluid or get a transmission flush so -PRON- be not sure if what -PRON- claim be   true   ram rebel -PRON- actually not really something i be seek outsooooo none i suppose yes and no -PRON- have be do this for over five year now and i live in the midwest so due to weather summer be -PRON- busy time of the year in past summer i think -PRON- have be a little busy but overall these people still have money and want to play with -PRON- toy so -PRON- will pay to play and be still in the positive fortunately so when enter college i be look for a parttime gig and find one as a part delivery driver for the company have an incredible manager who see something in -PRON- and be promote to counter associate roughly a year later i be ask to take over the porsche brand and the year follow come maserati and alfa lololol -PRON- be sorry to hear that however i completely agree in regard to a maserati most of -PRON- be po in -PRON- opinion and -PRON- lose -PRON- value fast than any car in production    out of the one i oversee porsche be certainly -PRON- favorite and i enjoy -PRON- as vehicle   be awesome and porsche as a brand really have -PRON- figure out as to answer if -PRON- be worth -PRON- maseratis be not at all if -PRON- have get the money for a porsche then go for -PRON- -PRON- d certainly like to own one someday if the price be right lol -PRON- be someone who be a big believer in preventative maintenance so for those that do not take care of -PRON- car well -PRON- get what -PRON- put in mopar own alfa so from a maintenance perspective -PRON- a little pricy however out of all the one i touch certainly the most affordable   alfa be very interesting to -PRON- because -PRON- make -PRON- -PRON- comeback in   and most of -PRON- be still cover under warranty the big problem -PRON- be see on -PRON- right now be probably the engine radiator on the stelvio leak frequently however right now -PRON- cover under warranty so   as for the   -PRON- that s tough as -PRON- have never actually drive one i hear -PRON- be a ton of fun to track but if -PRON- be do anything else in -PRON- -PRON- blow -PRON- have sit in -PRON- and -PRON- be extremely uncomfortable and -PRON- have hear -PRON- suspension be incredibly stiff price point wise i think -PRON- get a well bang for -PRON- buck in the cayman however that s subjective to what -PRON- be look for too nice   quite impressive good luck with -PRON- job   thank for get back to -PRON- the ghibli be a   in a silk blouse in -PRON- opinion the interior be just off the infotainment system be appalling and -PRON- be not particularly reliable   the   i own be a   model and i love -PRON- really be a super car for everyday need something big so sell -PRON- currently drive a   very boring and have order an   start to think i should have get the new cayenne porsche in the uk depreciate fast though especially cayenne thank -PRON- yours too future mrm president yeah -PRON- be just out on maseratis the only thing -PRON- have be -PRON- exhaust and the trident however -PRON- just do not seem worth the money   the new cayenne be beautiful imo and i think -PRON- be pretty stellar cayenne be easily -PRON- quick depreciator as well however between those and macan be -PRON- good seller due to live in the midwest with the weather seem -PRON- where in the empire business welcome d why have -PRON- never use social medium before this ama be invalid -PRON- have use social medium now -PRON- have never have access to -PRON- -PRON- seem really cool so -PRON- be disappoint i have not use -PRON- till now that s nice reddit have a reputation of be a super shitty and toxic site so -PRON- kinda a weird place to start if this be -PRON- first time here i recommend -PRON- stick to hobby or meme related subreddit anything to do with politic be incredibly cancerous   -PRON- be curious why do not -PRON- have access to social medium until now i start on vk and find -PRON- fun so look for other site do -PRON- suggest any subreddit i have not have the money to buy phone or anything so i could not use these rpublicfreakout and rdataisbeautiful be both rather interesting in different way i also like   rokbuddyretard however most of the humour there be extremely obscure and likely would not make sense to someone unfamiliar with reddit culture there s a subreddit for pretty much every hobby out there hobby related subreddit be usually the most friendly rcasualconversation be also a nice place   overall -PRON- do not really matter what subreddit -PRON- go on as long as -PRON- actively avoid politic -PRON- will be consume by athe hivemine very quickly after -PRON- spend too much time in rpolitic or rconservative thank   -PRON- do not seem toxic here there s alot of kind people like -PRON- i also do this be -PRON- special can i learn this power i want proof can i harness -PRON- power yes -PRON- can but -PRON- extremly hard i do not run out of the room when i turn the light off and i can bite icecream with -PRON- front tooth wow man so -PRON- be tell the truth yup but how tho   -PRON- secret be not run when i turn the light off and bite icecream with -PRON- front tooth how do -PRON- resist   by not run and bite the icecream do emma use reddit   yes that s what -PRON- say -PRON- be terrify

question and answer    question   answer   link   that s a huge accomplishment   be -PRON- true what -PRON- say about the sense of taste and smell be dull by smoking do those sense get strong again after -PRON- quit and if so what be that likeit be true but -PRON- have only feel slight difference if any really -PRON- sense of smell and taste have always be particularly strong even while i smoke so i would not say -PRON- be be too dulled during the last couple month before i quit i could not help be almost gross out by the taste of the smoke which be what contribute greatly to -PRON- decision to quit i still smoke pot so i guess maybe that s why i do not notice any significant change in -PRON- sense of   congratulation i quit recently too but now -PRON- be vaping    be there any scenario where -PRON- hard for -PRON- to not smoke like when drink with friend who smoke etcnope not at all for the first couple of day after quit -PRON- have have reflex thought about light a cig while sit at -PRON- computer mainly because that s where i use to smoke the most while game however -PRON- be just a habit to grab a cig whenever -PRON- d finish type something or when -PRON- d complete a game objective or get kill ie whenever -PRON- hand be free and whenever i could safely shift -PRON- attention away from the screen   like i say this habit be go after a few day and -PRON- have never have an urge to light be alone or with friend who smoke more to the point the smoke start bother -PRON- and -PRON- have ask all of -PRON- friend most of whom be smoker to sit by the window while smoke i now tend to avoid the company of tobacco smoker especially if there s more of -PRON- smoke in   nothing to ask just want to say congratsthank a   how hard be -PRON- to stopvery easy after i realize -PRON- be not actually addicted to nicotine but only have a nasty habit smoking pot help -PRON- realize this and help -PRON- quit every time -PRON- d have a joint i do not feel the need to have a cig for a couple hour afterwards so two year ago i just say fuck this shit -PRON- be finish this pack   more cig leave and never light a smoke again and i   how long do -PRON- quit previously -PRON- say twice and what s different this timefirst time i try quitting by gradually reduce the number of cig i smoke per day and -PRON- go really slowly -PRON- take -PRON- a month to go from one pack to   cig a day but i be not very determined about -PRON- i guess so i quickly return to burn up a whole pack a day   one year after that i decide to just cut -PRON- down to one maybe two cig a day and -PRON- work for a week but again i be not very responsible and be single with a lot of free time on -PRON- hand i spend hour in front of -PRON- screen which make -PRON- smoke more every day so again i be at a pack a day after only two week   another year pass and i literally tell -PRON- what an idiot -PRON- be and just quit because i know i be not hook and do not wanna allow -PRON- irresponsibility to go

smoke so i be glad that -PRON- quitto be honest i be well aware of all the risk during these   year and -PRON- do not stop -PRON- from poison -PRON- i only quit because i be feed up with the nasty

httpsgithubcomjohnsliaoamacompiler -PRON- be true but -PRON- have only feel slight difference if any really -PRON- sense of smell and taste have always be particularly strong even while i smoke so i would not say -PRON- be be too dulled during the last couple month before i quit i could not help be almost gross out by the taste of the smoke which be what contribute greatly to -PRON- decision to quit i still smoke pot so i guess maybe that s why i do not notice any significant change in -PRON- sense of taste nope not at all for the first couple of day after quit -PRON- have have reflex thought about light a cig while sit at -PRON- computer mainly because that s where i use to smoke the most while game however -PRON- be just a habit to grab a cig whenever -PRON- d finish type something or when -PRON- d complete a game objective or get kill ie whenever -PRON- hand be free and whenever i could safely shift -PRON- attention away from the screen   like i say this habit be go after a few day and -PRON- have never have an urge to light be alone or with friend who smoke more to the point the smoke start bother -PRON- and -PRON- have ask all of -PRON- friend most of whom be smoker to sit by the window while smoke i now tend to avoid the company of tobacco smoker especially if there s more of -PRON- smoke in group thank a lot same congrat g very easy after i realize -PRON- be not actually addicted to nicotine but only have a nasty habit smoking pot help -PRON- realize this and help -PRON- quit every time -PRON- d have a joint i do not feel the need to have a cig for a couple hour afterwards so two year ago i just say fuck this shit -PRON- be finish this pack   more cig leave and never light a smoke again and i do first time i try quitting by gradually reduce the number of cig i smoke per day and -PRON- go really slowly -PRON- take -PRON- a month to go from one pack to   cig a day but i be not very determined about -PRON- i guess so i quickly return to burn up a whole pack a day   one year after that i decide to just cut -PRON- down to one maybe two cig a day and -PRON- work for a week but again i be not very responsible and be single with a lot of free time on -PRON- hand i spend hour in front of -PRON- screen which make -PRON- smoke more every day so again i be at a pack a day after only two week   another year pass and i literally tell -PRON-

that s change for the well healthwise no more cough out nasty stuff every morning too i do not think -PRON- impossible evidently -PRON- s show -PRON- s able to quit but i do not have any good advice to offer to someone who s already manage to quit for a whole year except just do -PRON- again -PRON- obviously a choice -PRON- be once able to make so i do not see why -PRON- would not be able to make -PRON- again from what -PRON- have say -PRON- seem to -PRON- -PRON- just say -PRON- want to quit but be either not determined enough or do not really want to quit either way good luck to both of -PRON-   yes yeah i get that that be the hard part for -PRON- finish a game and not go outside to light up lol thank -PRON- awesome that s nice i see -PRON- mention that -PRON- be single when -PRON- try quitting be -PRON- now in a serious relationship do -PRON- think that play a role in motivate -PRON- mostly depression and addiction run in -PRON- family -PRON- be tired of cough and -PRON- staminahealth have clearly deteriorate over the last   year i be do good before the pandemic maybe   cigarette a day because i can not smoke at work but be stick inside all day hate life and -PRON- apartment i just habitually smoke all day when -PRON- be with the gf i try not to smokebut then i get irritable after like   hour i hope -PRON- be well the average age of s person with this type be over   so the odd be definitely well for -PRON- congrat bro i use to smoke indoor much bad the smoke linger for a while the smell just get into everything -PRON- be awful   -PRON- mention vape by the way -PRON- have have dozen of coworker switch to vape last year -PRON- be literally a rage where i work -PRON- be all so proud of -PRON- for -PRON- go nonstop about how -PRON- less harmful yadda yadda yadda even tho -PRON- be all basically use cheap crap manufacture in china and pay about   or so with crappy flavor etc after about two or three month i see -PRON- all back to regular tobacco i be in a relationship until a few day ago i quit before -PRON- start date but even if i do not quit before i would have quit then since -PRON- have asthma and could not stand be in the same room with someone smoke and yes date do play a certain role in -PRON- wish to quit because i do not wanna date people who smoke so i can not imagine why any nonsmoker would wanna date -PRON- make out with -PRON- would taste like kiss an ashtray i see depression and addiction be not strange to -PRON- even some of -PRON- family member be affect by both furthermore where i live most people smoke so -PRON- a very common occurrence even for young teen   -PRON- nail -PRON- with habitually right there -PRON- be just like i use to be smoke because -PRON- be use to and now because -PRON- have a lot of free time on -PRON- hand i would not say -PRON- be addict otherwise -PRON- d be struggle every day because -PRON- work only allow -PRON- to consume   cigarette a day   all -PRON- get to do be stop buy make a goal like i do   finish the pack -PRON- have get on -PRON- and tell -PRON- -PRON- be finally do with this fed up with the stench the awful taste the coughing all of -PRON- fuck this nasty shit   for a few day whenever -PRON- think about light up with that thought in the back of -PRON- mind tell -PRON- that -PRON- need -PRON- just counter -PRON- by tell -PRON- no i do not i just think i do -PRON- be not go to tell -PRON- to regain control over -PRON- because -PRON- already be in control this be not an addiction to nicotine this be a nasty habit -PRON- can just kick trust -PRON- -PRON- will feel much well without -PRON- and everything that come with -PRON- plus -PRON- have get -PRON- girlfriend to support -PRON- with -PRON- i do not have much support   all of -PRON- friend be heavy smoker if -PRON- s not a smoker which -PRON- be assume -PRON- be not judge by what -PRON- say about try not to smoke around -PRON- shell appreciate -PRON- more and be proud of -PRON- sadly -PRON- pass away after a few month of therapy -PRON- be a rare type -PRON- be   year old thank yeah -PRON- have never be a fan of smoking indoor and yeah alot of people where i live vape and i start in order to quit cigarette but now -PRON- be just hook on another form of nicotine hopefully go to quit the vape soon though i be definitely addicted to nicotine -PRON- mother smoke around -PRON- ever since i be bear as well as when -PRON- be pregnant drink as well    i agree with -PRON- that -PRON- a big mental thing but -PRON- be just not right mentally especially stick at home -PRON- be look for a new job because of covid so hopefully once that happen thing will get progressively well    the thing be when i be with -PRON- or do something that take -PRON- attention i can easily ignore the craving as i be distract or do something that take -PRON- attention -PRON- this quarantine that s fuck -PRON- right now    and drink ha that s so not fair   -PRON- be so sorry do -PRON- feel the need for the nicotine and how would -PRON- describe -PRON- -PRON- have never genuinely feel like i have an urge for the stuff sometimes just light the cig would feel as a relief and i would not even finish -PRON- -PRON- mom smoke before -PRON- have -PRON- then quit when -PRON- get pregnant and start smoke again after -PRON- stop breastfeed -PRON- dad never stop smoke i grow up in a household with -PRON- and dad father smoking and almost any male relative or friend that ever come visit smoke -PRON- be what normalize -PRON- for -PRON-   i now view -PRON- as a trashy thing -PRON- be not an attractive guy and -PRON- d turn down a literal sex bomb only because -PRON- s a smoker a huge no for -PRON-   -PRON- say be distract and work help -PRON- not smoke good find more distractionshobbie make sure whatever -PRON- be -PRON- help -PRON- from even think about light up also try replace cigarette with weed i do not mean that like replace one addiction with another but in -PRON- case weed have help -PRON- a lot since i have no urge to smoke a cig for up to a few hour after smoke a joint life be not fair most of the time -PRON- be sorry -PRON- have to go through all that too as well as -PRON- entire family and countless of other young or old who die from unnatural cause   thank -PRON- for -PRON- sympathy hope -PRON- kick -PRON- cancer in the butt i have some rage issue so for -PRON- -PRON- usually feel like -PRON- be on the verge of flip out and i take a few hit and -PRON- subside -PRON- be try to find a well way to control -PRON- anger rather than use a harmful substance at this point -PRON- be not even sure if -PRON- helping or if -PRON- be so used to smoke when -PRON- be mad that -PRON- brain think hey i feel well now i smoke a lot of weed as well the kicker i love spliff if i have weed i will not even smoke a cigarette because ill smoke a spliff but -PRON- still consume tobacco and nicotine so -PRON- more like a bandage on the wound rather than actual treatment    also i smoke so much weed cost too damn much haha ill burn an ounce in a week or less -PRON- may very well be an actual addiction but -PRON- may also be just a cope mechanism and take a few hit have a placebo effect   -PRON- have be hear all -PRON- life that people smoke for stress relief so naturally whenever -PRON- have be anger -PRON- d light up to calm -PRON- down but -PRON- d never really feel like -PRON- help -PRON- well damn bro an ounce can last -PRON- up to a month -PRON- need to cut that down too lol -PRON- both have somewhat of an addictive personality but -PRON- can not let -PRON- addiction dictate -PRON- life choice and lifestyle again go to work i can not smoke weed everything have get higher in consumption since lockdown i be plan on move at the end of the month hopefully and a change of scenery i think will help -PRON- mental stability good luck hope everything turn out well for ya'}"

       "'tldr do whatever the fuck you want so youre telling me people on the internet lie  this is so funny this subreddit got fucked by one person a note about celebrity request bans when riama thats the bigger sub had its peak wave of popularity about ten years ago that sub and therefore this sub was full of requests for amas  they took up about half of all the submissions  no one ever requests people at all anymorecelebs or otherwiseso that rule may seem a bit out of place  but before you would just scroll down this page and see a bunch of requests for will smith lady gaga the queen of england etc which was annoying because at the time it had like  people total  feel free to request classes of people to post amas though im not sure why that disappeared do you like cantaloupe what does ama stand for  i liked that guy he seemed like a really nice person hmmm ok thnx for clarifying all that but one quick q did cancer kid get like verified or anything before he posted so basically rama is a shitty knockoff of rima meant for telling your fake stories or just shit posting nice bbbbbb in other words common sense this seems to be rare nowadays sadly is the rule for posting and commenting im good with that  happy cake day heh a decent human wtf is ama mpp question what does ama stand for or mean im the producer and co host of the we talked about this podcast happy to answer any questions on how to start a podcast advice on editing or producing the podcast  just ask away whats is ama im learning how to do this for the first time with a throwaway  so what ever happened with coma girl she turn up fake why cant i post  no be a decent human and then do whatever you want cant stop a karen from believing crap  cant stop goose kids from being kids ask me anything i honestly cant tell if youre joking no he lied  so he definitely didnt verify when i first took over this subreddit i had meant to simply link it to riama since people confused the two  i kept rama up because i didnt want to effectively delete all those amas  rama is meant to be an alternative to riama thats less strict and where you dont have to be an interesting person necessarily  if someone is definitely lying well ban them  but the risk you have by coming here is that perhaps some people lie just like anyone can lie to you anywhere online  i could be lying about how i wanted to initially just link this sub to riama    you just have to accept it for what it is ask me anything stands for ask me anything ask me anything i found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked   httpswwwwayfreelancingcom  i did the honors for you         uundeleteparent okay what are all of your bank details lol yep lol ik dude i was kidding its just funny to picture everyone repeatedly asking yall that question but even a simple verification pic for serious posts would go a long way idk tho maybe if the posts are really popular itd be nice if there was some sort of verification  but i understand after all you arent getting payed for this thanks 🙏 ooooh thank you 😅 undeleted comment   what about those annoying goose kids that keep talking about shagging animals  i am a bot  please pm me if i mess up    consider httpspaypalmeundeleteparent no no worries or just dont spend money on reddit awards u shoulve seen the guys username its was  i cry nice nice why are you here     its been half a month nice its pinned whats been your weirdest encounter and also happy birthday wish you the best that award was my early birthday gift since i dont feel like waiting 🤷\\u200d♂️ also thank you for your service i guess to anyone who might ask specifically what i do or whatever here is the gist   pretty much anything involved with the safe handling and transportation of our patients plus some nonpayment jobs so ill bring patients from the er to thier room admitted patients transferring them from room to room including the icu  when they are being discharged  sometimes bring them to imaging xray ct ultrasound vq scans even patients coming from a helicopter too ive been up to the helipad a handful of times its a great view   yes i move deceased patients to the morgue and yes i have to open up the body bag to verify its the correct patient no not babies ive got the same birthday as you happy birthday happy birthday however tell us about the most karen patient you had to transport also i shouldve been clear i meant to say i cant celebrate how i wanted to which was being at dodger stadium behind home plate double fisting tall cans all night and eating dodger dogs 😂 and ending the night with conga room or la cita bar lol happy birthday i am a nurse and we really appreciate you and your friendliness with the patients and your hard work and that award was for being on the front line salute its my birthday today  but its coming to a close different time zones do you think youll have cake  do you even like cake  i didnt but i bought some goodies to share with my workmates tomorrow drop your wishlist sensei  have you ever encountered someone with schizophrenia ps happy birthday lacusc medical if i had to guess happy birthday     when transporting face shield and mask or just mask also gloves or no gloves my birthday is the  too how well does the job pay happy birthday man and also thanks for ur service my question is what was the age of the oldest patient u transported and how was himher happy birthday  thank you for your work  exactly how patient are you  and thank you and happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday and thank you for being there helping first line workers are too often underappreciated  human logistics you poor bastard i thought being a courier was bad enough only live thing i transported was baby chickens to a teen ager for experiments so that was weird  i did move containers back and forth between hospitals and ivf facilities those folk have all the worst jokes i didnt even get a chance to make any of my own why cant u celebrate it  table of questions and answers original answer linked  please upvote the original questions and answers   question  answer  link  that award was my early birthday gift since i dont feel like waiting 🤷\\u200d♂️ also thank you for your servicethat caught me off guard 😅 thanks for the reward kind stranger yall are very welcome i genuinely enjoy what i do 👍 whats been your weirdest encounter and also happy birthday wish you the bestwierdest encounter as in with a patient id need you to a be a bit more specific because ive seenheardobservered so much stuff throughout the years 😅 and that award was for being on the front line salutethanks kind stranger much appreciated 😌👍 happy birthday however tell us about the most karen patient you had to transportoh man i might have to come back to this one because somthing you need to learn right off the bat is to  have thick skin meeting people for the first time at a hospital is not ideal so if they give you attitude you wouldnt know if they were told  minutes ago by a doc that they have aggressive cancer as an example so many times you let shit slide  buuuuuuuuutttt the number of people ive brought up from the er to thier rooms because they are staying a night or more and they are unhappy because a the room is too small some are somewhat small or b there is not a nice view out the window  and only once have i had a patient absolutely not want to stay in a particular room that they signed a paper stating they are refusing medical treatment and they left eyup because of a room what a waste of time and resources precovid  ive got the same birthday as you happy birthdaywoop woop happy birthday ♌ 🥳🥳🥳 hows the bitcoin coming along ur  have you ever encountered someone with schizophrenia ps happy birthdayas far as i know negative unless its been written in thier charts but i dont think im allowed to fully read it i dont bother besides finding thier mrndobname 🤔 its my birthday today  but its coming to a close different time zones do you think youll have cake do you even like cake i didnt but i bought some goodies to share with my workmates tomorrowhappy birthday 🥳🎂🎂🎂🎂 uuhh hell yeah i will ice cream cake cookies and cream my fave i do hate fruits onin cakes lol they just dont go well together fight me lol you are a blessing for doing that i sure hope you had a wonderful day 😌🍻if you  drop your wishlist sensei wishlist  this covid shit would go away  to go to a fucking rave its my escape from life lol  fly to central america and see the fam  fly to space imagine how much of a mind fuck that would be hell yeah  sky dive  go to la vita barcongra room those clubs are my favorite and they are always a good time 😂 lacusc medical if i had to guess happy birthday   when transporting face shield and mask or just mask also gloves or no  negative but even if you guessed right i wouldnt say youre right lol  thank you much appreciated 👍  we are required to wear a mask at all time inside the hospital so theres that and i bought my own face shield so i wear them most of the time especially when in the er or if a patient has a breathing vent is intubated which we would also wear an  mask ass well  thats a tough one because the biggest thing you want to do is avoid any cross contamination and since i also move covid patients that something you really want to avoid  with that said some health guides and what we have been taught regarding ppe has changed once covid started i wont get into full details cause every once in a while it changes again and i dont want to give miss information regarding how we usedispose of said ppe  most of the timenow at least i do use gloves the entire time i transport but when i have to press buttonsuse my badge to access doors i use the backside of my gloved handthe nonleast contaminated side or my watch to get a hold of my badge or press say the elevator button this lowers the risk of spreading anything im sure i missed some stuff but im trying to get to eveylry question now if you have more ask away  my birthday is the  too how well does the job paywhen i started basepay was  ish morning and weekdays working mids and nights pays even more and working weekends adds to that  with my  years and usually working weekends im at around  ish now no hazard pay though  human logistics you poor bastard i thought being a courier was bad enough only live thing i transported was baby chickens to a teen ager for experiments so that was weird  i did move containers back and forth between hospitals and ivf facilities those folk have all the worst jokes i didnt even get a chance to make any of my ownhuman what lol honestly i love my job i get to see the ins and outs of a hospital ive seen some gnarly shit go down and the friends ive made are friends forever wouldnt change it until i get my xrayct license 😈  aaahhh shit to a teen yeaaaahhhh 😂😂  lmao in a place full of disease and sadness sometimes a bad joke to break the stress is just what you need 👍 lol but you gotta be quicker  exactly how patient are you  and thank you and happy birthdayhow patient am i  i watch youtube videos without skipping the ads  in all seriousness if you are going to deal with patients you need very thick skin so far not a single patient has gotten remotely close to getting any kind of attitude from me its been almost  years working  happy birthday man and also thanks for ur service my question is what was the age of the oldest patient u transported and how was himherthank you kind friend 😊  ooooooohhhhhh i would say somewhere around  nothing particularly interesting about that patient tbh just kind of there hate to say it but on their last moments imo  ive had many  year old who walk and talk as if they are still young hell just last week i admitted a  year old and this guy practically ran from the gurney into his bed 😂 i joked and said not to run away he replied with  i wouldnt want to embarrass security lmfao thats how i wanna be when im old 😂😭 happy birthday i am a nurse and we really appreciate you and your friendliness with the patients and your hard workand thank all you nurses for literally fighting this tough fight  i hope you are safe and stay safe during these times nurse and i wish safety for you and your colleagues 👏👏  personally i wouldnt be able to do what yall are doing i feel like i would get too attached to my patients and having to bag someone i got attached to is the biggest no no for me 😬 why cant u celebrate itbecause covid said fuck  and dodger stadium is closed where i wouldve been tonight behind home plate double fisting tall cans all night while enjoying dodger dogs 🤤🤤🤤  happy birthday  thank you for your work dont mention it i love what i do and it brings me joy

coping with the stress of the job   happy birthday whats the worst injury youve seen construction related as far as stupidity goes ive see people nail fingers together fall of scaffolds fall through celling  or whats the funniest case youve ever felt with so with all the bad shit youve seen are you more grateful for what you have in your life and the people in it or does everything suck happy birthday happy mutual cake day  how old are you turning when was the last time you properly celebrated it if youre a patient transporter do you mostly take people who are close to death and need more support from a different hospital or are you taking release patients to rehab centers because they have gotten better hows your birthday going so far happy birthday day a bit late but have you ever delt with suicidesuicidal patient but hes staying on the scaffold about  up off the ground and he was cutting a beam above him not level but straight up and down vertically and when he got through cutting he just rested the saw on his right leg and when he rested it up against his tool bag the blade grabbed his leg he been doing it for about  years at this point i dont know what made him do it but then again we all have those days i have those days or i do dumb ass shit for no reason i dont know what makes us do it just being humans i guess a lot of times on them jobs you dont have any workers insurance and when you get hurt and you might get fired but hed been working with us   years at this point i dont know why hed think wed get on to him but whenever he done it i told him to come on down off the scaffold and ill take him right then i was the formen the job its just a mixture of that and him not wanting to look like a pussy in front of everybody else yo birthday twins and it happens yeah ive never done it because im more careful than that knock on wood but give anything enough time itll happen he made a full recovery and is back to working  days a week with us happy irl cake day happy birthday  for you 🍕 🍔 🎂 🍀 🎁 🎉 haoli la hanau from kauai happy birthday how are you holding up with covid  am i correct to assume your hospital has a lot of covid patients dwr  credit card information phone number mothers maiden name im just kidding what is your favourite type of cheese to all the kind people that gave me rewards thank you very much i wasnt expecting that im pretty sure i responded to everyone and we had fun conversations too stay safe out there everyone and thanks for the birthday wishes 😌🍻 i know a guy was cutting a beam and had the skillsaw still going and stuck it to his leg he got a  inch gash he tied a price of shirt around the top of it worked till we took lunch  or  min he sat down and said hey man you gotta take me to the hospital and i did 🤣 happy birthday cuntwad wierdest encounter as in with a patient id need you to a be a bit more specific because ive seenheardobservered so much stuff throughout the years 😅 that caught me off guard 😅 thanks for the reward kind stranger yall are very welcome i genuinely enjoy what i do 👍 ive been stuck in hospital wayyy too much in my life and you guys are fuckin awesome and under appreciated woop woop happy birthday ♌ 🥳🥳🥳 hows the bitcoin coming along ur username mine too birthday gang august  gang best gang oh man i might have to come back to this one because somthing you need to learn right off the bat is to   have thick skin meeting people for the first time at a hospital is not ideal so if they give you attitude you wouldnt know if they were told  minutes ago by a doc that they have aggressive cancer as an example so many times you let shit slide  buuuuuuuuutttt the number of people ive brought up from the er to thier rooms because they are staying a night or more and they are unhappy because  a the room is too small some are somewhat small  or  b there is not a nice view out the window   and only once have i had a patient absolutely not want to stay in a particular room that they signed a paper stating they are refusing medical treatment and they left eyup because of a room what a waste of time and resources precovid times and thank all you nurses for literally fighting this tough fight  i hope you are safe and stay safe during these times nurse and i wish safety for you and your colleagues 👏👏   personally i wouldnt be able to do what yall are doing i feel like i would get too attached to my patients and having to bag someone i got attached to is the biggest no no for me 😬 thanks kind stranger much appreciated  😌👍 happy birthday 🥳🎂🎂🎂🎂 uuhh hell yeah i will ice cream cake cookies and cream my fave  i do hate fruits onin cakes lol they just dont go well together fight me lol  you are a blessing for doing that i sure hope you had a wonderful day 😌🍻if you drink wishlist  this covid shit would go away  to go to a fucking rave its my escape from life lol   fly to central america and see the fam  fly to space imagine how much of a mind fuck that would be hell yeah  sky dive   go to la vita barcongra room those clubs are my favorite and they are always a good time 😂 as far as i know negative unless its been written in thier charts but i dont think im allowed to fully read it i dont bother besides finding thier mrndobname 🤔  negative but even if you guessed right i wouldnt say youre right lol  thank you much appreciated 👍  we are required to wear a mask at all time inside the hospital so theres that and i bought my own face shield so i wear them most of the time especially when in the er or if a patient has a breathing vent is intubated which we would also wear an  mask ass well   thats a tough one because the biggest thing you want to do is avoid any cross contamination and since i also move covid patients that something you really want to avoid   with that said some health guides and what we have been taught regarding ppe has changed once covid started i wont get into full details cause every once in a while it changes again and i dont want to give miss information regarding how we usedispose of said ppe   most of the timenow at least i do use gloves the entire time i transport but when i have to press buttonsuse my badge to access doors i use the backside of my gloved handthe nonleast contaminated side or my watch to get a hold of my badge or press say the elevator button this lowers the risk of spreading anything  im sure i missed some stuff but im trying to get to eveylry question now if you have more ask away  when i started basepay was  ish morning and weekdays working mids and nights pays even more and working weekends adds to that   with my  years and usually working weekends im at around  ish now no hazard pay though woopie thank you kind friend 😊  ooooooohhhhhh i would say somewhere around  nothing particularly interesting about that patient tbh just kind of there hate to say it but on their last moments imo   ive had many  year old who walk and talk as if they are still young hell just last week i admitted a  year old and this guy practically ran from the gurney into his bed 😂 i joked and said not to run away he replied with  i wouldnt want to embarrass security lmfao thats how i wanna be when im old 😂😭 dont mention it i love what i do and it brings me joy when i see my patients leave the hospital hopefully i never see them again in the hospital 😅 how patient am i  i watch youtube videos without skipping the ads  in all seriousness if you are going to deal with patients you need very thick skin so far not a single patient has gotten remotely close to getting any kind of attitude from me its been almost  years working this thank you kind stranger 😊👍😌 thanks friend i love what i do and even though i directly dont take care of patients like nurses i enjoy what i do and interacting with people 😌  im sure well get our xth pizza party soon lol 😅 human what lol honestly i love my job i get to see the ins and outs of a hospital ive seen some gnarly shit go down and the friends ive made are friends forever wouldnt change it until i get my xrayct license 😈  aaahhh shit to a teen yeaaaahhhh 😂😂  lmao in a place full of disease and sadness sometimes a bad joke to break the stress is just what you need 👍 lol but you gotta be quicker friend because covid said fuck  and dodger stadium is closed where i wouldve been tonight behind home plate double fisting tall cans all night while enjoying dodger dogs 🤤🤤🤤 lol i guess i shouldve been more specific celebrate it how i wanted to 😅 yes i just move patients in a hospital i have  medical schooling all we need is a bls card no further licenses and degrees but id have to take a very educated guess and say yess it definitely is hard   honestly if i were to be anything nursing doc etc i think it would be an anesthesiologist being able to be in the or and seeing everything go down but not having to do the very messy stuff seems very intriguing but thats just my guess of what they do lol happy birthday zakulon i wish you a very happy day in these tough times friend keep your head up high and do things you enjoy today best wishes ooooooooffffff uuuuuuhhhhh  griffin yeah griffin thanks kind stranger if i may ask what part of the world woop woop happy birth day to you too erialll heres to us leos and i hope you have a good one too friend 🍻 this one is a tough one because you meet all sorts of people on a daily basis that you tend to forget even the very goodbad patients  but one  can foundly remember was of an older gentleman in his late  or so who had the most uplifting spirit ive ever seen i was transferring him from an overflow area to his new room and he would crack jokes every couple seconds that really made me laugh and he sang the last couple minutes as we where getting him situated in his new room and he was flirting with the female nurses in a respectable manner in my opinion plus the nurses were getting a kick too lo   it was funny and wholesome i hope that guy is well in life such a calm and fun soul  yeeeaaahh happy birthday to the lioness and  too ill cheers to that cheers  yeah i have something planned with a few friends for dinner i shouldve been more clear on my tittle i meant i cant celebrate how i wanted to which was being behind home plate with a beer in each hand at dodger stadium lol  aww man you didnt have to do that much appreciated fhalfpap i hope you and the fam have a great day and tell your daughter i said happy birthday birthday twin 🥳 lol  years young my friend 👍 if i can remember to recheck my comments ill come back and say happy birthday buliteup but in case i dont happy early birthday friend heres to us celebrating a lack luster birthday lol cheers happy birthday to us hip hip horaay   happy birthday to you too shadowcatamount cheers friend have a fun day i shouldve been a little more clear on my post im still doing something small with a select few of friends  however what i really wanted to do was be at dodger stadium behind home plate with a tall can beer in each hand eating dodger dogs while enjoying a beautiful baseball game at the ravine   but thanks for the birthday wishes and questions n ultimatebutttoucher hahahahah love the name lol have a good one friend  my favorite band would have to be all that remains  finally got to see them live for the first time last year it was a blast and first ever concert i went to as well  and i went solo and i caught a drumstick from the opening bands drummer all in all fucking great and memorable night  next up would have to be lamb of god if there is ever a moment i need to get pumped up log had me covered   what about yours id love to hear it i spent the first  hours responding to questions and im having a blast responding to everyone so yeah im have a fun day so far thanks for asking   i hope you are well too  lmfao believe me that feeling gets worse and worse and im only  enjoy those years youre only in your teens once   fyi i dont think they are open because of covid but please dont go to a strip club to celebrate its a waste of money   like jayz said   wanna know whats more important than throwing away money at a strip club credit   have blessed day friend and be safe out there cheers  i knew there was a few comments i would get back to  sorry for the late response but i think i responded to another redditor on this  anyway the most awkward one was when i was transferring a patient from to a new room and this dude kept hitting on every female nurse we would passpretty rudely too and caressed  doctors hair as we passed them i was pushing an iv pole and and the bed so my hands were full it was so awkward and i kept saying sorry to everyone and kept telling the guy to stop but he didnt thats been the most awkward one sorry to those nurses and doctors thanks friend much appreciated ill be with some friends for a house dinner later tonight  negative never though if someone did that would be illegal bringing a patient home with you hmmmmm lmao but there have some some good and bad moments that come back with me some haunt me to this day and some cheer me up so theres that happy birthday to your lil lion cub   btw have you head the book krampus the tile lord by gerald brom i dont read much but that book was fun and got me more into reading  bday dinner with a select few friends at a friends house although i really wanted to be at dodger stadium behind home plate with  a tall can beer in each hand enjoying the game sigh maybe next year lmao i love that zoompleaños i gotta let my family know but many of my tias and tios arent good with tech so i doubt it would be that successful also it helps that most of my closest friendscousins work in the same hospital as me so its not as bad if we see each other since we work in the same place but we still try and keep it at a minimum  thanks for the comment  suspect user name hmmmmmm all my bones check out im watching you would this happen to be indiana by any chance you dont have to answer that if you dont want to i think i was talking to a friend in the past hours talking about a storm or something   anyway i hope all that clears up soon and you get power back up friend stay positive and youll be able to celebrate soon enough thanks for the comment notjustrocks  happy birthday  cheers to us mate 🍻😊  question for you whats been the scariest moment rock climbing assuming by username of course lol thanks friend i appreciate that very much   and i appreciate everything you medical workers so too yall the mvps  i will say sometimes a patient and thier nurse just never got alongwell when im dischargingtransferring them i play devils advocate and just side with the patient even when they are in the wrong per the nurse because ill only be seeing them for a few minutes anyway so if this can change thier mood for the next nurse or person they interact with then so be it in the end everyone is happy thanks  but its all about slytherin  happy early birthday to you lion friend cheers to us i hope you have a good day manana friend  🍻 happy birthday to us captanbug 😂hahaha cheers 🍻  uuuhhh in the beginning it was kind of stressful cause it was a new environment and what not and you dont want be in peoples wayinterrupt etc but now after almost  years its like whatever sometimes you have to get in nursesdocs case because they are taking way too long and are delaying patient care which in my opinion is always fun lol thankfully no patient i have moved has coded and thus needed to do cpr knock on wood the day that happens fuck idk thats my biggest stress i guess   even in the er where its the most hectic you learn to stay calm and collected i hope this answered your question friend if you have anymore ask away  oh man this would have to be around  years in it was a  year old romanian chick man she was gorgeous and she was companied by her mom too lol   anyway the entire time they kept chatting with me and were genuinely so nice and friendly  it felt like i knew them for a long time yet we had only met and talked for what i think was  min total transport time luckily enough i discharged her and was able to seetalk to her one more time but damn she was beautiful woo happy bday to you too cloudyissafeaswell cheers mate 🍻 i love los angeles so much do and the food variety is top notch what i dont like is how people just dont give a fuck about keeping safe during these tough times especially in my neighborhood south central many times you go to a liquor store mofos arent wearing masks and dont care that shit is annoying especially given the fact i work at a hospital and see first hand how covid can affect your body  it just extends the amount of time we have to stay like this untill things go back to normal thanks willchangemynamelatr 🥳🥳you never did did you lol   welp heres to hoping things start to settle soon lol happy birthday to your pops angriguru 🥳 thanks msink means a lot really  honestly my part in the healthcare system isnt that stressful im in contact with my patients at max  minutes if the transport is taking very long but aside from that everything just seems like second nature now the covid patients i move and that are vented is stressful cause its more exposure but i make sure all my ppe is properly on and fitted before i move   i guess the most stressful thing is not being able to vent out at barsclubs raves baseball games those were the places i let loose and let everything go and have fun but none of that is open so im stuck at home bored and dealing with it sigh lol thanks msink means a lot really  honestly my part in the healthcare system isnt that stressful im in contact with my patients at max  minutes if the transport is taking very long but aside from that everything just seems like second nature now the covid patients i move and that are vented is stressful cause its more exposure but i make sure all my ppe is properly on and fitted before i move   i guess the most stressful thing is not being able to vent out at barsclubs raves baseball games those were the places i let loose and let everything go and have fun but none of that is open so im stuck at home bored and dealing with it sigh lol interesting questions honestly i cant think of a patient that came in related to construction injury odd i know 🤔 ill say this though my uncle many years ago stupidity was using a circular saw cutting a  hanging from his leg well lets just say high rpm and blood makes for an interesting painting 🤦🏽\\u200d♂️ he is good though but man was that dumb   dude had a butt plug stuck inside cause he fell asleep while having fun interesting convo as i took him to preop but boi did i laugh after words the guy was cool though albeit embarrassed lol wow great question  its wierd really for me at least  death doesnt seem to affect me much my great grandma died a year ago but working at a hospital ive just kind of learned that death is just life people live people die its a way of life nothing we can dothe world just keeps on spinningmaybe thats made me a bit cynical idk but thats one    ive definitely taken the fuck it full send mentality which is if you have money and time to do something do its better to have said i did it than saying i wish i was there  this one comes from the numerous young fatalities and realizing these kids never lived life to the absolutely fullest and im only   so yeah i do appreciate things way more now but at the same time ive learned to just let things go with the bad times in life  hope that answered your question i couldve gone in mor detail but im answering every question on here lol if you have more ask away  thanks  have a good one mate 🍻 thanks  🍻  years young  and every year for the past  years its been my thing to go out to a latino club with a bunch of friends and just dance  i may not be the best dancer but i do enjoy a good time with friends 😌 so im a a transporter inside the hospital i dont move patients from hospital to hospital   i do move patients from  the er to thier room transfer them from room to room discharge them when they finally go home yay take deceased patients to the morgue yes you read that right and i have to open the body bag to make sure its the right person and pretty much anything related with moving patients i do with some exceptions that is   hope that cleared up some confusion and if you have a new question with the added details by all means ask  so far its meh but i have a bday dinner with a select few friends at thier house so it should be fun ill probably play some fall guys on  for a bit and then do some work outs to get my body energized lol thanks mate cheers 🍻 👍 hmmmm good question as far as i can no there have been many od over doses  but i have no clue if it was suicide or not the patient was out cold and im obviously not going to ask the patient when they are alert  and its not late its aug  here in the los angeles so ask away ive been answering everyone   i meant why would he wait so long so say i need help lolthats what i meant  nonetheless i hope is doing well now 👍 fuck that id rather look like a pussy than bleed the fuck out i guess even with so much experience something like is bound to happen hopefully nothing like that has happened and wont happen again happy birthday fellow leo 🥳🥳🍻🍻🍻 thanks friend much appreciated 🥳🍻🍻 pizza burgers and is that strawberries on a cake 😤😤  fun fact about me i do not like strawberries at all lol  jokes aside thanks friend cheers much appreciated 🍻🥳 im holding up ok to be honest i havent contacted anything thankfully and eyup there are a good amount of them all around the hospital i wouldnt be able to give you an estimate though as everyday patients come and go   cant give away the info i took my self 😏    her name is jefa spanish for boss lol   i should get more into cheese cause i love it but pepper jack i know boring  any recommendations 😊 now why the hell would he do that lmao now thats an idiot lmao 😂 thank you very much  if we throwing insults for fun here in that case   thank you very much smegma dingle berry breath 😂 yeah i guess weirdest encounter with a patient hello birthday twin  happy birthday   its your birthday now thanks friend we are just doing what we can i hope all is well in life now the name is a bit of a meme never used bitcoin lol its my birthday too happy birthday nice happy birthday happy birthdays yikes i couldnt imagine refusing treatment because they didnt like the room was there anything wrong with it cant imagine not wanting treatment just because of a room i was in the icu for a month and i had a terrible view out of the window i was bedridden for the entire stay in the icu aswell  heart transplanted  also do you ever crash into things when transporting patients like bump into walls or have you mastered the skill my nurses told me they spent an entire day learning how to make a bed but spent no time learning how to drive them so basically theyd rather die than go inside of a room they dont like  good to know they have their priorities straight i was talking about an amazon wishlist so i could gift you something for your birthday but oh well guess ill have to fight corona now  better get ready  thanks for ur answer btw i think that ur work is very important expecially because i am going to be in the army and all medical staff are like angels for us not a problem hope you can celebrate eventually hell yeah i love pizza parties enjoy the next one   greetings from france you went from professional adult to idiot drunk hyper emoji fuckwit in like fuck all hours same i couldnt celebrate either south east asia  thats the best kind of person imo hope youre having a great day happy  thank you hope today has been great for you 😄 happy birthday to you too   had to have those number combos huh hahaha cheers thanks im basically the mayor of squaresville over here so i was really just hoping to get slightly tipsy on wine in montreal  is the legal drinking age but that dream is tarnished haha oh jeez that sounds like a nightmare thanks for the reply awesome hope you have the best time cheers 🍻🎉🥳  hmm i really havent had too many scary moments my favorite climbing is lead and or trad climbing outdoors and i try to make sure i dont do anything above my skill level so i guess my scariest moment would be when i was lead climbing and a storm rolled through and started raining on me 🤔 the rock was definitely a little slippery i was protected from the rain until i had to top out and get our gear last couple moves were a little sketch we had some absolute amazing transporters who at least acted like they loved their jobs it made such a huge difference for everyone i hope you can share this post with your coworkers for some inspiration grazie and likewise cheers   and it did awnser my question thank you im glad its not too stressful of a job i probably couldnt do anything like that xp cheers yea i dont get why wearing a mask is so difficult  is la as expensive at it seems ive always wanted to live in a big city when i get older ur welcome i realized right after that u cant change ur  reddit usernames haha he says thanks you too 😀 who doesnt i hope it gets less hectic for you sometime soon i can only imagine if youre in la i probably was one of those ods sadly  ive been to  hospitals for unintentional od unfortunately  were in san bernardino county  were in la county and the other  was orange county  of them were intentional 🍨🍰🎂🍦🍭🍧 buti thought they were cherries  😂opps forgot something 🎈  hmmmm this one is tuff cause i see a lot of wierd shit  but encounter wise i was moving a patient once that was out loudly hitting on almost every female we passed by and the patients even caressed the hair of a few docs i tried stopping him but moving a bed and iv pole with both hands makes that very difficult 😬   so yeah that was a very awkwardwierd couple minutes  now if you wouldve said scarygoreiestsaddest thats a different story happy birthday to you too cheers mate 🍻🥳 thank you friend  damn couldve been mighty rich right about now 😏😂 ive been waiting to say this my entire life  same to you happy birthday ok tbf the room they had still a private one was in an overflow area an extension of the er if you will   so it was a big area with some privates walled off rooms which my patient was already assigned to  they didnt like the fact that outside of thier room against the walls were other beds and only curtains separating them believe me i thought the same fucking thing some people can be real picky and it blows my mind smh  some of our icu rooms have windows behind the bed so the patients that are alert cant even see outside consider your self lucky   seems like everything went well im glad your still here with us friend 🥳  hahaha naw at this point almost  years doing this ive mastered the craft many nurses have told me how much of a good driver i am fitting through tight hallways maneuvering around people ect like anything with practice comes confidence and im very confident in my handling of the bed  but when there are many iv lines and other things that can be caught and potentially rip off i do take my time and make sure everything is good before trying to get in a tight space  with that being yeah of course ive bumped into things not at full speed never that but sometimes its just unavoidable for instance many of our rooms entrances give us a few inches of play to go in with the bed so sometimes i purposely bump the side of the bed a bit on the door frame for leverage to turn the bed when im transporting solo   the hardest things to move are some of the icuair beds air mattress beds because they are battery operated we they essentially drive them selves but when those fucking beds have no power get ready to move a  lb bed plus whatever the patients weights imagine pushing a large  wheeled wagon with  with one hand while holding on to an iv pole with the other its happened to me but in those cases i obviously ask the nurses to help out if they are transporting with me believe me i was dumbfounded but whatever its thier life not mine cant force them to do anything what can you do 🤷🏽\\u200d♂️ you are kidding i would never allow that to happen  but if there is something on my wishlist its  a new  controller  and an snes classic  lol hey thanks my friend best of luck out thier serving us be safe and a word of advice from a cousin who wasis a marine he liked keeping a lil journal and dotting stuff down from time to time as time went on as he deployed he looks back on it and relives fun moments idk if youll be able to do that but meh i figured id throw that out there  have a good one ima still celebrate just not how i wanted too i shouldve been more clear on that 😅 il y avait un peu de sarcasme dans ma réponse nous sommes un peu fatigués de la pizza ici haha lol who says i wasnt already drinking before i started this thread also  with all the crap going on in the world and dealing with covid face to face any small glimpse of fun you can find to break the monotony of recent months you take it and run with   so idk if youre being serious with this response or not but im having a blast responding to everyone like yall are my friends so ill respond like so if thats so bothersome so be it sue me   all in all though im still having a blast responding to everyone  since i woke up i havent stopped responding to every question im having a blast so far lol but the day has just begun itll get better lol some for you pffffttt dont event worry about the square thing you do what you enjoy and dont let anyone tell you other wise just go buy yourself a bottle and enjoy it at the comfort of your home no shame in that drink as you listen to your favor songs you do you friend youll enjoy it and wont regret it   the amount of times friends have called me a bitch etc because i dont want to take hella shots at parties is countless but i know my limits and i know i dont do good with shots anymore so no nasty hangover and i remember the night so its a win win for melol yeah it was awkward thankful it was a quick job and it was finished within like  i felt bad 😭 yeah i genuinely love what i do i see the ins and outs of a hospital and that to me very intriguing many nurses ask how i have the energy to stay so uppity at  in the morning but i cant go into a patients room with out some kind of flare every patient of mine gets treated with respect and kindness its the least they deserve no matter what crap life has thrown thier way  will do when i go back on thursday thanks again for the question ive been having a blast responding to everyone  believe me this is probably the least stressful job in healthcare in direct contact with patients i only see my patients max  min if the transport is taking long after that the nurses take care of them untill they are good to go home or well die personally i dont think id be able to bag a deceased patient because i feel like i would get too attached and would be heartbroken but thats just me  yes it absolutely is freaking expensive im not even going to lie to you  mmhhmmm suuurrree 🧐 lol have a good one mate honestly i dont see things getting better until after august next year the earliest well my friend let me extend a hand of friend ship and say if you ever need a person to talk to and vent with  judgment and like memes and dark humor im your guy i hope things are looking up for you now dont hesitate to reach out the worst that can happen is im busy and teapot late stay with us friend you are loved here 😌💙 arent they strawberries i cant really tell lol ill take your word for it yum and thanks for the balling time for hi pitched voices lol  im interested in hearing all three if you dont mind sharing have a good one from ireland 👍 ill just send you some cheap drugs that i stole from the mafia bruh now i have to give you a  controller and fight corona that shit do be hard though not a problem my friend btw i will serve italy not us but is basically the same because italy and us are alliedi hope to end up in the rear instead of in the front lines i have great potential as a strategist and leader fair enough lol all my birthdays arent celebrated how i want first of all  i love how were acting like logs person in the wild like fuck you you fucking fuck  also where do i piss in this place  thanks man your ride is shit mine is better no mine is fucking terrible haha  i too am drunk but seriously i hate emojis i dont r really know why but may be i cant meme but at least i cant splle   anyhoo fuck youre fucking fucks  much love and crazy over take maneuver hah true im working east coast hours which is why i think its so late already thats what i thought unfortunately probably not but one can always hope thank you really needed that happy birthday to you and thank you for your sacrifice of being on the front lines of this pandemic need the tea sis hippa and what not means i wont go into detail regarding the patients but  saddest  being called up to move a  week old deceased patient to the morgue which was wierd because we never do them i get up there i see the baby such an innocent soul gone   early late teenearly  kid thier mom comes to the er because her son has been shot dead the screams of a mother crying over her child will still gets me  gore havent really been part of a mangled mess but i did have to take a deceased patient from the er to the morgue and the floor and some of the wallscabinets were drenched in blood i saw this before it was somewhat cleaned up for us to go in  scariest only once has this happened to me i work night shifts but walking down a long hallway empty and silent as fuck and the lights starts flicker on and off fuuuuuccckkk that i thought i was in a horror movie for a bit its been the only time its happened so far and i was legit scared 😂😂  and i guess its seeing covid  icu patients hooked up to a bunch of stuff and vents down thier throats and realizing many people that think its a hoax wont see this part and realize its not so theyll continue on like nothing wrong so this shit will keep on spreading extending the days we return to fucking normal sorry for the language but man im fed up with people not taking this shit serious oh man a buddy of mine is planning a bachelor party in dublin once all this is over i cant wait to visit and see the views cheers orange teslas and shrooms only please fuck it ill take acid tabs too i guess well either way best of luck to you in your future endeavors my italian friend i wish nothing but happiness and safety when to go out there 👍👏 why not why not plan a birthday yourself and do it the way you want hell it doesnt even have to be on your bday but a day you gift yourself near your bday ive done that i hope you do to and have a great day friend easy coast arent yall like  ahead of

least commercial pilot if they arent its illegal to pay them to fly im not sure if the person paying them can be held responsible but it is best to know if they do have that certification also make

up in debt forever a condo for me bunch of rental props and land for developing debt isnt neccesarily a bad thing but cancel out as much irrelevant stuff as possible too many people pay for hulu netflix spotify disney and prime only to use like  or two of them invest in a low cost sp  index fund only keep enough money in savings to get you out of trouble if something happens invest the rest dont invest into bitcoin or some fad dont go on rwallstreetbets i dont buy things in grocery stores that i consider to be too expensive   the closest store to me is a whole foods so i generally shop there i avoid as much of the organic or gmo free shit i can because its more expensive  if a store has a rewards program or something i sign up for it no plenty of investors already probably not sorry only immediate family   they are actually very responsible and respectful what is your platform by voting you mean funding your campaign right  my entire life  i wasnt very happy no but money buys freedom with freedom comes the ability to find happiness in simple everyday things like waking up and having absolutely nowhere you need to be i dont need to hunt not too difficult i had the same problems everyone has not long ago student debt rent etc  i have tons of middle class friends that have no idea im rich took a few weeks to claim the money the majority ill buy my family whatever they want i dont buy very many expensive things day to day i structured most of the money into some funds  best purchases youve made  my ferrari  spider my condo a classic truck for my dad etc  worst purchases you made  the hican smart bed its really nice but most of the app functions dont work and the fragrance diffuser stopped working almost instantly yes ive been to most of europe and asia what do you waste money on now that you didnt used to  bottled water   and do you have many new hobbies  kayaking shooting jetskiing the numbers matched i tipped a former coworker of mine who i used to work at a sports bar with  one time   just came in made casual convo and tipped her on the receipt shes a mother and it was almost christmas time  she called me several times afterwards probably to thank me and i just never answered   theres some other examples of this as well two i have a condo what was the first thing you bought  technically my lawyers services after that my debt after that i

minutes after the drawing   have you moved from your town   yes to the capital city  do you plan to leave and join high society  i guess im technically a part of high society now i live in a very high end condo complex  whats your favorite place youve traveled to  amalfi mid  its hard trusting women i had a lot of girls come to my house and start taking tik toks and shit flexing my stuff thats because they spend the money as soon as they get it not knowing they have to pay another  or more on it after the first year  or they start businesses with little experience the majority of startups fail no so good i rotate between a lamborghini urus rolls royce phantom drophead and a truck bugatti veyron no work i only told family they were shocked we are closer now than we ever have been some people i went to hs with messaged me to check up on me when they never cared before   im single  no kids our family is closer than ever how much would you say you spent on new clothes shoes etc  too much  did you buy more high end fashion or stay cheap  custom louis vuitton varsity jacket dior biker the lv virgil denim jacket a few lv graphic tees some gucci stuff some stuff from the dept de la gallerie collection the versace cowboy patches jacket some amiri jeans few odds and ends the majority of my closet is topman asos and american eagle lol  also did you start any collections or anything like that   some hyped sneakers not much of a collection no transcripts how old are you  mid   how did you first feel in that moment when you found out  utter shock and disbelief   are you married if

possession of the ticket i was slightly worried but he wouldve had no way to claim the ticket   i have two accountants and an investment planner you should take everything with a grain of salt even on riama  im not going to supply any info that would identify me just pretend everything is creative writing on reddit lemme see your transcripts i dont know what that is this is how much that was left after the initial tax and the first year income tax i used this number intentionally because both taxes vary state by state and it makes it much more difficult to determine the jackpot amount have we talked before thats a lot for a lightbulb cant give that info as it would identify me the lottery office takes it huh who knows you can have a grand ole time very graceful id be pissed if i was someones manager and they told me to fuck off because theyre now a millionaire kudos to you classy im a supervisor and people that quit with no notice are assholes psha you should be doleing out the plat bro im guessinghoping you turned down all of this people just dont seem to understand the concept that knowing someone with money  having money do whats best for you this was your luck not theirs and it sounds like youve handled it very responsibly god dammit can i have one 👉🏻👈🏻 what was it like going to the office to get the money did you opt for lump sum could you remain anonymous why was nobody grateful my  brothers ars annoying to the rest and my parents are anti vaxx karens that blame me for everything wish they were normall  i bought tickets for over  years  never won anything worth mentioning meanwhile my father won   tried to get back into my life by dangling  over me  said no despite kind of needing the money because he wasnt worth it      congrats though at least youve done something decent with your winnings amazing causes good on you trevor project god bless your soul well from your comments it sounds like youve taken good precautions and are about a sensible as a lottery player can be   do you mind me asking finally whether you still work or if not what you have been occupying your time with since sweet im torn between a prebuild condo or chunk of land that makes sense my hope is to not worry about bills one day thank you for the advice thank you for your fast response thats good to hear i wish you nothing but luck enjoy you deserve it transparency in governmentcivilian interaction universal basic income and universal basic healthcare antiparty anticorruption actions  protections for those who cannot protect themselves reduction of the industrial private prison complex and the end to the war on drugs  equality of opportunity for all  if you want to know more i have a sub always looking for active discussion   best six dollars ever spent or nah and now   do you wake up wake up everyday thinking fuck yeah im rich or do this lifestyle also come with unforeseen challenges this is what ive always imagined having freedom doesnt make life perfect but it seems to make it way more peaceful congratulations on winning i guess   dollar bills should be enough to craft a paper mache girlfriend in your   i didnt have any middle class friends when i was at that age  are your friends older than you wow so are you living a good life in a pool in a mansion with a ferrari or is it not the usual cliche winning the lottery youd be a great grandparent then i wish i had a rich family member my momdad never buy me anything my first electronic was a handmedown from my uncle srry but my friend asked u if you could check out his go fund me   you dont have to donate anything to him but i did promise him i would send it okay thats super neat if it were me id pay off my familys debt  my own buy some land  build a custom home id give my family members money to build their own houses too and of course get a few more rescues i have  already but only so much room right now id probably be pretty modest with my money tbh im pretty low maintenance  would probably keep it low key  oh i would travel too have you considered traveling at all where would you like to go nice i loved the little bit of europe i went to last year hope we both get to enjoy some more after all this covid stuff is over i was wondering more if it was the powerball or mega millions as a former waiter i applaud you for that kind soul 👏 condom good choice smart are you from a big city or a small town why would people be contacting you if you stayed anonymous nice ferraris are cool but my dream car is a bugatti chiron super sport wow  interesting  thanks for the quick response btw you are a big lotto winner but not a big loser nice enjoy life bro be safe that is my dream car fair enough  im jealous af though either way  ive planned out my lotto scenario in my head for years  half to friendsfamilyvarious charity keep other half to pay off debts and secure my familys future for the next generation or so    hope you find happiness if you havent already what was your initial reaction to the winning thats understandable for sure and yeah theyre one of the companies im thinking of for working towards i did a tour of one of their facilities and the people i was with were amazing ive been on the larger planes for vacations and such but i never realized how big the engines really are until i stood next to one im  and could easily stand inside of some of the intakes for those that is a good idea what was the best thing you bought for yourself very cool in my winning the lottery plan hiding it from the people around me besides my immediate family is what i always get stuck on i think ill go with  im an investment manager for a high net worth client in which the client is me have you played the lottery since then and how long did it take you to get the hang of managing the money wooooo youre whole life to enjoy it also where you on the news nice i understand if you dont want to give your age but could you give a general age of how old you are when you won it thats awesome to hear  do you ever plan on working again i always felt like if i won enough to retire id still have a part time job doing something i dont know why 🤷🏼\\u200d♂️ wow thanks for the quick response  😞 good deal congrats 👍 you dont have to show anything that would identify you i got a  portsmouth you did this ama before right do you atleast remember any info about it proof you are lying you could of just said im not lying but instead you said something that implies you could be lying and i think you did that cause youre a liar i was a manager as well i know you get what you get and you dont throw a fit sure 🥇 what was it like going to the office to get the money  i did not go to the lottery office a lawyer did on my behalf as he represented the trust i opened to stay anonymous   did you opt for lump sum  the lump sum is the best financial decision so yes  could you remain anonymous  answered above kinda dumb lol good on you for sticking to your guns recently my dad won  and we used it to buy new shoes and clothes for school it really helped my family since the extra  stopped and now itll be hard to just get food my brother is gay and i unconsciously bullied him for a while because of it i was ignorant  i donate to try and make amends with myself and the lord i have a few investments which i passively manage   i do probably  hours of work a week land chunk if you can afford to develop probably    little of both   i swear i get audited every year by the irs or buy one of those wacky japanese dolls  kidding maybe most of my friends are students at a college that i live right next to private school  theyre generally the same age i have a few friends in their  as well i dont have a mansion but used to have a ferrari i found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked     i did the honors for you         id pay off my familys debt  my own  did it  buy some land  build a custom home  thinking about it  have you considered traveling at all where would you like to go  ive been to most of europe and asia mega millions enjoy your gold small town people you knew before take notice that you suddenly stopped driving a kia and now you drive a ferrari and live in a highrise   they dont know i won the lottery they just assume i got really rich the chiron is a bit much for me someone at the car meets i attend owns one and has over  miles on it theyre unbelievable cars   i looked into veyrons before miller motorcars offers complimentary service for a few years on them  value but i cant justify owning something like that   maybe someday i am definitely a big loser lmao the engine note is insane utter shock i didnt sleep for days for sure   i meet a lot of pilots when i travel and one of my favorites was a delta pilot he had served in desert storm as well as iraq he reminded me a lot of sully just the level of experience and professionalism you hear in the way he talks a loooooooot of coke  kidding i loved my ferrari i havent played since   i rely on  accountants and a financial planner to help me no news doesnt care if trusts win  it just doesnt make any sense to okay what do you propose i show transcripts tho yep im not going to give the winning numbers as that can be used to identify me lmao ok to stay anonymous   considering all the afformentioned people from above it seems like you did not do a good job at this like isnt the unofficial rule to tell absolutely no one like not your mother and not your child who did you tell i respectively disagree kindness is not dumb bitterness selfishness etc is thanks yea ill be honest that shit wasnt easy but i cant say i regret it  nice  gg to your dad i feel you though going through some slightly tougher times myself currently what matters is who you are now in case you havent read my comment i want to tell you one important thing about the lotto for the wise winning the lotto is a blessing for the fool its a curse statistics show the same thing hopefully youd be wise about it ❤️ the land i would sit on for a few years as where land is avail here isnt super sought after until development comes later on with the new highways for that amount i would let irs

there before as well  what brought you back from going through with it congrats and glad you are here  how do you feel about it and whats the biggest change that has brought you happiness ever since then the legend of the phoenix when i was institutionalized for the first time and i was expected to share my life story someone said i had phoenixtier resiliency they made me a bracelet with letter beads spelling out the word this idea that every time i crash its because i have the opportunity to pick up the pieces and build myself up stronger again is what continues to drive me today i have found that determination is so much better than stubbornness so now when i feel like im at rock bottom instead of letting it consume me i recognize that the only direction left to fly is up thank you so much friend and remain strong 💪 ❤ my best friend at the time thank you i used to mope around on the anniversary then it became a celebration now its just a day to chill and  post an ama i guess its a bit surreal every time this day comes around as for happiness still working on that one i changed my habits and hobbies and got rid of toxic friends now i need to figure out how to make new ones thank you stay strong we got this your welcome is good that now you have something more to celebrate and share with others and yet you have own it and made it more upbeat works in progress are the best because there are tons of choices you can make and in exchange discover something new about you good luck with making new friends perhaps they will pop up in one of you daily activities or daily interests and will surprise you  what do you think is the secret that most relationships fail to figure out these days me n my gf are only  months but im really feeling this one and were still really great right now i just want to know from someone like you cause there doesnt seem to be many good examples anymore my man 🍻  do you guys have kids if you have kids that might be traumatic communication is the most important thing if youre angry then tell your partner and talk it out like adults if you like something tell them and  theyll remember it and repeat it this goes for meals they make things they wear things in bed etc if dont like something then tell your partner if you never say anything then your partner may never realize they do something that bothers you tell them your fears and desires i grew up in a home where communication wasnt a think it took a long time before i could be open with my thoughts things get better the more we are open love her till your death love her like youre her saviour love her like youre her jesus love her like youre willing to die for her love her like youre not merely a man but a god you have to eat ass eventually two kids ages    we have  kids but theyve never caught us how i kinda think its better to show kids their parents love each other unless you consider sex is totally not about love otherwise why not because no kid wants to think about their parents having sex unless they live in alabama but they know or they will know eventually i am not telling you to demonstrate it before kids its private of course our kids are  and  so when they are mature enough we will be very open about sex and how its not something to be ashamed of for now we show affection in front of the kids well also alot of the times you shouldnt relay on sex to help your children understand that you love each other you should be able to show them that even outside of the bedroom whats the most morbid wish youve received who hands down was the worst child you ever seen yes santa  my mum loves mall santas we have a favourite one we visit every christmas im  shes  we go talk to him and take pics and all i was wondering if this is normal thats my general area how do you handle the cold are the suits isolated for the weather or wet things that may fall on your suit do women ever have santa fantasies they want you to help play out or like fetishize you for being santa im thinking of the movie bad santa here  the woman who was totally turned on by the thought of sex with santa this looks like a very cheerful ama during this times   whats the most upbeat experience you have had as santa within those years and how do you think this christmas is going to be the kid who wished his babysitter would die for not allowing him to play with his xbox past his bedtime  i also had a kid wish for their dead father to come back and i uh needed a minute after that when i started in this business i did a gig near detroit one kid jumped off my leg he mustve been  or  and he was behaved really well up until it was time to go when he started running around the sleigh that was behind my chair and eventually jumped in it before pulling some of the empty presents out of my bag and throwing them everywhere the mom got involved there was a fight and it held up the line  also one kid had some bladder control issues and pissed on my leg yuck yeah go ahead and take pictures with us its fun just dont do it when the line is too long otherwise you might hold things up a little too long my suit is mostly insulated from stuff like that i usually tell kids i live at the north pole but i live near midland michigan which depending on the time of year isnt much different and often ill put the suit on shortly before arriving at the venue luckily i havent had a situation where it that being said moisture has uh been an issue before and it luckily is pretty good about keeping it out and off of me  on my way to a christmas event in ohio i got pulled over wearing my suit it was odd to say the least ah this is definitely the kind of question going on my naughty list  i have moms flirting all the time its kind of normal comes with the territory without giving away too much im happily married and ive worked out a few funny lines i can use to reject the advance well i dont think mrs claus would approve  ive been hit on by a dad before it was awkward also there was a group of twentysomethings dressed like toddlers complete with a  pacifier that gave off really kinky vibes and used it all as an excuse to flirt with me some people do weird things ive gotten plenty of adults sitting on my lap some of us do have padding or frames in our legs to mitigate the weight of heavier children and nonchildren on our lap the time a dad came back from war and greeted his son as he left this was kind of close to joliet pretty much the kid was really bummed and missed his dad and i had gotten a note from the mom that kind of said act oblivious to it and so he runs up to his dad after leaving my lap brought a tear to my eye and the next little girl yelled santas crying  like something out of a movie beautiful day truly a christmas miracle  without getting too political i fear for how christmas and generally life is going to be affected by the pandemic i certainly hope that christmas is a time where we come together whether republican or democrat black or white man or woman etc christmas is a time of unity and hopefully we can just for one day look past pandemics and politics and just come together as people even if you dont believe in a christ we still can unite around christmas the time of year where everything is good god see this is the reason i hate children  thanks santaaa  your job is so appreciated thats heartwarming to know that little kid got the best christmas gift you got to feel that joy and movie like experience while the kids got to see santas emotional side   thats true the pandemic has changed many things and created an outburst of underlying problems that have gotten worse i guess thats what makes holidays special that just for a moment you can kinda forget about the problems and just celebrate theyre alright most issues are with the parents thanks this comment is going on my nice list it was amazing that was a nice part of an otherwise terrible day that day my car got dented on the rear drivers side door and a kid almost had an accident on my leg  couldnt have said it better myself merry early christmas i definitely would say that the great moments make it all worth the bratty kids ruined legs and near heatstrokes that come with the territory at least something positive happened during that day and things didnt went beyond repair but yes the perks of being santa  merry early christmas for you too and thank you for sharing with us i love doing so it makes the entire job worth it   merry christmas to you as well youre on the nice list useemyeyes is this question

the biggest impact possible i like being interviewed how do you know what your scared of until you do it if you dont have experience for anything you will go nowhere  no response they got on my nerves i was suicidal at  i got the help i need and i have never been happier no im  no lady i think im a decent chef stuff actually im a polar bear alright how do you respond to allegations that you murdered a spider in cold blood those are an endangered species yta that mosquito had a wife and kids s interesting thats wonderful that you want to be a role model to the countless of redditors out there what do you say to the naysays who say youre so far away from reaching subs like rcenturyclub that you are in no position to be an aspiration just yet  i want this karma so that when people look at my cunt they had something to aspire to brilliant im going to forward this answer to my faqs i like the way you think if according to you water isnt dry then how can other liquids like wine be considered dry im glad for you stay strong dont mean to sound ignorant but does an  year old feel suicidal i dont think i even understood why people killed themselves at that age i definitely get it now ive had some trouble with depressionand i still dobut i dont think at  i had to mental capacity to even process the thought of killing myself relating to my own experience i also congratulate you on your strength hello everyone welcome our new ceo excuse me  did you say you sat on a baby heres the new potus the claims could you expand on that offtopic but your thoughts on love on a spectrum it was just a question i wasnt offering anything your report says you are a diy proctologist care to explain hmmmvery impressive but sadly you didnt list honesty in the skills section you only listed your twitter handle oh ok no sorry it is true they are doin your mum doin doin your mum oh im so sorry for the misunderstanding i thought i was interviewing fred teeven you should a politician getting out of an answer like that welp due to work policy ill give u mine i was in year  aged  me and my friends were chilling in the gazebo while the boys play fight thenone gets pushed and lands right in my lap the whole class lost their shit youre hired  when can you start are you joe exotics daughter are you sure about that we found your dna all over the crime scene what what the first subreddit you joined good good you will be hearing from us soon sorry lmao didnt see your username okay good fair enough ooof i didnt even read into the comments to find out how old you were this is extremely awkward and i should add that it was extreme shock value satire not an actual suggestion  i apologize for being crude lol that was very interviewy ok thats all i know i said a few but here at abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz we are unprofessional i failed  grade twice thank you for your time and welcome abord you may pass i see thats standard for the winning team moving on outside of the corporate water balloon fights what qualities or strengths do you feel that you could bring to our company no you took a lot of time to answer that and im going to have to press you for a more detailed answer thats my duty as a reporter thank you your hired logan saylors  and for what reason was it justified its even worse than i thought youre hired thank you i really didnt expect for you to get ny reference congratulations you were being interviewed by a rfuckwasps representative you will be contacted soon ha lol thats what i said no not that whyd you do it are you avoiding the question the question was how did you feel about those claims and are they true so you refuse to disclose any information regarding your involvement in the run of hate crimes against the romani people of northern italy and slovenia sorry maam my use of sir was incorrect as was your use of your oh sorry your microphone was muted what did you say again why october interesting what is your stance on the abuse of teapots yes yes thank you wave if you answer me ill give you a cola i pledge as innocent spiders a beautiful addition to the earth thats not interviewing per se thats questioning do better i wish everyone liked that whats century club because its not water theres alcohol and stuff in wine  stoopyman thanks username checks out i understand your point of view but i also had suicidal thoughts that started when i was pretty young suicide can seem like an easy way out especially when youre young in ops case i think it was because of medicine  for me it was an unhealthy situation at home children are capable of understanding much more than we give them credit for sometimes but you cant understand something that youve never encountered before   i cant speak for you but if youve had a happy childhood without worries then understanding suicide would be pretty hard the opposite is also true if youve always been sad then it may be hard to learn how to be happy  or how to stay happy thats what im struggling with mostly i thought the elections werent until november if youre going to use  staples just use one i hope he did because if not then he isnt qualified all hail the claims we are i guess you could say wired differently so we have a different point of view on things well i dont want any from anyone im sorry but you must have someone else report could i see if please oh well nope its ok i had really bad connection and im taking time to get to every question but sure go ahed did you not see my name lol because i wanted to i misunderstood i did not have any contact with him the allegations are false the fbi has forbidden me to disclose anything im so sorry i agree and feel we need to switch to unbreakable options i agree what about in hot blood probably redditors who have over  million karma i hope op can concur who mine if i may expand on that as an autistic person i feel like everyone is standing in one corner from the room and im standing in the other corner everyone is still looking at the same room but im just looking from a different angle thats why i may miss some details normal people would immediately see but im also able to notice things others wouldnt normally see it allows a fresh point of view to both parties when talked about what examples can you give regarding your creativity want some coffee well  under claims like this you are in no position to make demands apologies i wasnt trying to be pushy or rude i just wanted to play a pompous interviewer sorry if that irked you thats not a valid reason to do you have any proof of this coward username checks out your asking the real questions here  yeah as someone also autistic in my case having a photographic memory helps me draw more accurately no im good i do not make demands but am simply suggesting that you look at my profile and be the judge you dont want to then you dont have to no problem no i mean i am pretty stupid and my name is definitely yaas so i guess as someone who is also autistic i cant draw for shit so am i im looking at your profile with vivid pictures of you checking up your patients you sicko then how can i trust this claim smooth well that was wierd chacha i was asked a couple times about what my alters are like rather than copy and paste this to each person im posting as an individual comment this is my list of alters ive had

do you have how are they different how are they similar im ok with an essay of youall are thanks for doing this can you willingly switch to one of your alters or does it have to be triggered by something have you watched the united states of tara do you think it was accurate when the other alters arent fronting is there like a place they hang out in your head lol i saw you answered a question about the movie split what do you think about the character jane from doom patrol if youve seen the show do you think its a more accurate depiction of did minus the superpowers obviously than split or not  or do you have an example of a character with did in a movie or a show or a book you find accurate and interesting can you please tell us about your college plans congratulations by the way how do you think your diagnosis will affect your college experience  table of questions and answers original answer linked  please upvote the original questions and answers   question  answer  link  do you know what caused your traumathe experience that caused my first split was when i was  years old at least thats what my therapists and i believe its the first time i really knew the alters were there it was caused due to an extreme physical attack by my stepdad at the time my splits i had multiple came from physical and sexual abuse i endured as a child and early  one thing i was always curious about but felt it would be insensitive to ask is if your alters can talk to each other like can they communicate in any wayits not insensitive at all haha its like a radio station or podcast in the background of my mind they can definitely communicate its just weird at times like when trying to go to bed and just listening to the toddlers a  and  year old sisters blabbering about wanting ice cream 😂 how many alters do you have how are they different how are they similar im ok with an essay of youall are thanks for doing thisi have  of them you say youre okay with an essay well i actually have a list of them written in my phone cuz theres too many to keep track lol so if you want i can copy and paste them in a comment  can you willingly switch to one of your alters or does it have to be triggered by somethingyep both actually  have you watched the united states of tara do you think it was accurateive actually never heard of that before but im gonna check it out do you know if its available on youtube or  when the other alters arent fronting is there like a place they hang out in your head loli think of it as like a frat house lmfao its like having multiple thoughts all at once just in different voices or listening to a podcast  radio station its pretty cool but not so fun at times  i saw you answered a question about the movie split what do you think about the character jane from doom patrol if youve seen the show do you think its a more accurate depiction of did minus the superpowers obviously than split or not  or do you have an example of a character with did in a movie or a show or a book you find accurate and interestingim learning about so many new shows  movies with did and it and im just shook haha ive never seen doom patrol actually  i watched a film in high school about did in my psych class and i got to share my experience then too but the film eve black was a somewhat decent portrayal it was a simple way of showing what it can be like though not super exaggerated or super minimized they were close when it comes to curing did for most recognizing the trauma or event that caused the split is enough to help control it or even eradicate it by accepting what happened and learning to cope and move on for some its that plus medication plus a shite ton of therapy my route though not everyone diagnosed with it will be  can you please tell us about your college plans congratulations by the way how do you think your diagnosis will affect your college experiencesure im actually moving into my dorm next monday i was able to get a medically accommodated single dorm thanks to my therapist  im going to school for early childhood education already have my aas but want my bs to teach preschool after that and im all settled and in a public school teaching i wanna go for my masters in clinical social work and have my own child and adolescent therapy practice   i dont think my alters will be too much of an issue but they definitely have their moments im thinking being away from most of my triggers and reminders of my trauma will keep me and some of them calm and not needing to come out although the freedom could also have the opposite effect and end up having them go buck wild 🤣 do you have alters if so how manyi do many actually 😅so far there is  documented its at the point i have them written down in my phone because its hard to keep track  what is didoof yeah i shouldve put that in the description lol dissociate identity disorder previously and informally known as multiple personality  what do you think of the movie splitsome parts i loved and some parts i hated with a burning passion i genuinely loved the fact that they used a lot of true facts though  alters being out at once was a big nono lol showing the huge differences in the alters disability  illness age gender it was amazing to finally see that on a big screen yknow but the whole physically growing taller and more muscular and climbing walls and just flat out supernatural stuff kidnapping teen girls and killingeating them yeaaahhhh that had me pissed lol the big thing that got me was portraying it like this horrible thing that causes people to be criminals its already a huge stereotype but i mean its fiction  can you describe some of your alters personalitiesi just offered someone else this but i actually have a list on my phone if their names and little bits of what theyre like if youd like i can post it as a comment on the thread for you to check out  do you have any idea when youll be done doing didwe actually dont know we think im going to be stuck with them for a while 😅 whats your favorite personalitydefinitely the children theres a  and  year old theyre sisters and they are the sweetest little things definitely sneaky too  do you think that split the movie is an accurate representation of did leaving the beast aside    do your friends know you have didleaving the beast and all that horror stuff aside absolutely the only thing they didnt get accurate was two alters being out at onceyeah no haha very very rare does that happen but they did very well with showing the different alters with the many ages genders traits and even disabilities and illnesses it was amazing seeing that  also yes not all of them though my partner and my closest friends  do you think i could ask some of your alters something if not how scary is it to walk around in publicgo right ahead its no problem at all  being in public can be difficult at times thankfully i get along well with most of them so its easy to keep them in check so to speak sometimes ill have one of them come out because im just not in the mood to socialize or life 🤣 this mau sound dumb but how do u know that u arent the alter personality and that one of them is tge real person also can u ask them questionsso its funny you ask that when i go inside its like blacking out sometimes im completely unaware of anything that happens others its like im sitting in the audience at a theater theres actually a possibility i myself may be an alter and the real host is what we call dormant my therapist and i along with my alters think that when i had the first split i became another alter and the true me is the host but essentially comatose in my head itsscary to think about the fact that i may not actually be me  also yes i can definitely ask them questions and so can you  depending on which one youd like to speak     httpsgithubcomjohnsliaoamacompiler do you have alters if so how many what is did what do you think of the

alter and the true me is the host but essentially comatose in my head itsscary to think about the fact that i may not actually be me   also yes i can definitely ask them questions and so can you  depending on which one youd like to speak to thanks for sharing so openly im sorry people are shitty  is your situation safer now by all means if youre willing im sure im not the only one whos curiosity has been piqued can you make one of your alters respond to this i think it would be funny to see what they have to say its on hulu or showtime its really good its about a mom with did brie larson is in it thats really cool im so proud of you and i hope you have a long and fulfilling career 💓 ahh ive heard of that but know nothing about it if you wouldnt mind could you explain it to me like im five do your personalities ever directly communicate with another yes pleaseee wow this is amazing so you say you were diagnosed at  right what happened that made your parents take you to therapy did they give you a possible cause okay so you said jax hurt other personalities how did he do that sorry if this is a sensitive issue  on another note do dogs act differently around your personalities this question is based on that sometimes dogs are more protectivelenient towards different peopls thank you honestly it wasnt for a while but ive actually been living with my best friend since march and im moving into a dorm at my college next week for my bachelors  definitely better than i ever imagined haha definitely not i posted the comment  thank you so much 🥺❤️ sure thing and like your  too 😉  for starters it is extremely rare to be diagnosed with and has caused controversy in the psychology field thats the main thing people know lol   its almost like having different people living in your head think like a frat house of sorts a buuunch of people all just living their lives just sharing a brain  body its caused by severe traumatic events which makes the personalities split into different parts for me it started with  new personalities   theres always at least one known as the tracer which is the equivalent of pam the secretary extraordinaire they keep track of how many there are and who they are sometimes the tracer knows of more than the host the main personality aka me  each alter can take control at any time though many times they are triggered by certain things for example when my anger reaches a certain level one of my alters takes over because she the more violent one and likes anger though nowadays she comes out as a way to calm me there are very very few cases of two alters being out at once and its believed to be impossible   lastly the most interesting part alters can have completely different medical issues i have autism asthma a plethora of issues none of my alters are autistic two have asthma and most are neurotypical they also all look completely different at least in my head   i apologize for the essay i tried to be as detailed as possible while also not boring you 😅 its hard to explain but kinda but just in my own head its like im talking to myself and listening to a radio station  podcast at the same time its freaky at times 😅 just posted it ☺️ they werent too keen on bringing me they were abusing me and my first split was caused by my stepfather they were forced to bring me to a child psychologist because i was showing major signs of depression talking about my alters didnt know what it was at the time and other things the school told that if i wasnt brought to a specialist to be tested and receive diagnoses for my behaviors then they would have to contact cps i stopped opening up the person because of fear but i dont really figure out the cause of the first split until later im life when i was about  years old its hard to explain really but through a lot of manipulation basically tricking them into doing things when they come out and scarring them also putting them into situations of physical and sexual trauma him being out provoking my parents or abusers and then making them come out to endure the aftermath   also surprisingly yes its pretty cool haha brothers dog lived with us for a while plus the ones i grew up with got used to the majority of them but certain ones absolutely terrified them and pissed them off it was scary sometimes coming out and seeing my dogs growling at me only to then jump on me and lick the hell out of my face and cuddle thats awesome you deserve a good life wow not boring at all thanks i am so sorry that happened to you i really hope you are doing much better i am also sorry i made you remember that do you feel better now aw its totally okay you dont need to apologize  i do feel a lot better than i used to im moving into my dorm at college next week and ill be away from all of stressors and i am ecstatic haha looollll im moving monday too haha aye monday moving club 😎😂 how has this affected her throughout her life how did she feel when she realized she was in danger how do you feel about flashing images with no warning its really stupid but as i have seen most people who dont give warning just arent educated on photosensitivity edit i have a strong tolerance for that stuff so i guess count me lucky yeah i agree im not epileptic but i tend to feel a bit sick if i stare for too long and its just overall not a good feeling to me i cant imagine how hard it must be if some people go into seizures that could possibly kill them i would ask if yall are hiring but my lady might see this   you said worked so what do you do now do you keep in touch with their children since they are technically yours sounds good and bad at the same time do you regret it til natural inseminator is a job title was it mostly single women were there any couples was it weird i have a lot of questions whats the weirdest scenario in which you had to reveal your job title eg tax audit first date etc was the sex just business or did you have fun with it i dont like your former job it means you hurt women in a legal way to me especially when you say they are willing to leave their partner for you how did you make sure none of your clients would ask for child support did you have them sign a contract im in an entirely unrelated field now  i really just saw it as an easy way to make money and pay off student loans i had the right qualifications—appearance health profile academic record—to be a desirable donor and the pay was very very good yep it depended a lot on my current client i dont at all many were couples  it was only as weird as the clients felt about it part of my job was easing them into it ha dating problems were actually why i quit  im a goodlooking guy and hookups were easy to come by except when i had to save up for work but its pretty much a nonstarter in terms of a relationship with  of women it was satisfying pretty much no matter what sometimes it was also a lot of fun i was providing a service i wasnt in control their feelings nor did i ever lead them on yes that was all handled by an agency what was your worst client huh thats interesting i presume you were well paid was it usually a one time thing or did you have to go multiple times did any of your clients wind up having an emotional attachment do you think any of the offspring will try to contact you down the line i cant share specifics even in an anonymous context but my experience with clients depended mostly on their disposition rather than their appearance although my favorites were wonderful and very attractive  i presume you were well paid   very   was it usually a one time thing or did you have to go multiple times   it depended on whether it worked it often took multiple sessions   did any of your clients wind up having an emotional attachment  oh definitely more than one even signaled that she would leave her partner for me it was something i had to be very careful about   do you think any of the offspring will try to contact you down the line  it wasnt something i thought about much at the time but it seems inevitable some will not a question but im proud of you and i am sure you are an inspiration to many people at your school even if you dont know it yet  thats very brave of you what made you decide to come out thank you so much this makes me so happy  thank you a lot of people are homophobic in my town so it was hard but it paid off i realized that a lot of people in my town werent open about gay rights only place i felt home at was the skatepark i used to wear rainbow croptops and no one cared ive always been into fashion and i wanted to embrace that at school but a lot of hate would come with that it was very tense but i decided to walk into my school oneday wearing a pride shirt that i made i was questioned by a lot of people about it and i gave them the response im gay a lot of the females accepted me but the boys would judge me in the locker room and never felt good having me in there with them i wouldnt even look at them i stood in my old path and hung out with the couple of guy friends who didnt care about how i felt welcome to small town usa right lol thats awesome im glad you had some good friends but im really sorry people were mean to you it makes sense that youd want to be able to express yourself better now haha i guess so i try not to let it get to me even outside of school you have to stay positive hate happens to everyone no matter who they are same bro     question a frog rides a unicycle if the unicycle wheel begins at rest and

now and wish you the best as for a question are you a picky eater mentally ive improved a lot still have a long way to go im literally just a ordinary guy a man although i still feel like a young boy most of the time honestly thank you i used to be incredibly picky much less so now but it depends some days im open to trying anything but sometimes if i get a weird idea about a food its hard for me to try it most things i do try i eat tho how are you feeling what did you do with the hair i would like to see you now what caused the breakdown im gonna get some coffee you want coffee slams images of recently upvoted posts on the table a solid amount of memes here i can see primarily from rmemes a few from pewdiepie submissions and my partner here managed to find a few from markiplier subredditnow with evidence like this we could close this case in seconds with a good jury and put you away as a normie for a longlong time unless you confess and spill the beans maybe then we could cut a deal now tell us what was the dankest meme so far this year i reccomend you tell us quickly my partner doesnt care much for normies who use rmemes much and i can only hold him back for so long whats your favorite tv show you can tell me this stays between us where were you at  pm  takes out baseball bat how many children are in the basement id love some actually honestly i dont really have a favorite tv show i barely watch tv at all cut to the chase where did you stash the cocaine are you sure you wanna stick with that answer uhyeah you dont sound very sureidk if thatll hold up in court noi mean yes i meanfine i love  fiance alright you got me and id frickin watch it again ya hear me thats what i thought its always  fiance what classes did you have with him did you fight him can you show us the yearbook picture what was the worst he got embarrassed at school math and animal science i jerked ricegum off the football team jerked him off wtf whats the story behind that how do you feel that holocaust denial is illegal in the us people would get so angry if that was done here have you noticed any hostility towards older war time generations due to the younger generations feeling resentful for bearing the brunt of national guilt or are the older generations generally respected  it must have been confusing for children to learn about these atrocities in school and not have it affect their view of grandparents etc what is your  favourite german food well the nazi thing is a big deal how do you feel about the holocaust how much racism is prevalent in your part of the country  are there any hitlernazi sympathisers in your citycountry one prejudice may be german words can be really long and hard to pronounce  what is your favorite type of sausages i always want to try liver sausages wht do you think of denmark does it bother you germany gets so much hate for  but japan doesnt even though they did stuff equal or even worse than the germans do you think the output from the mass immigration in germany justify the input do you hate americans has your family been affected by the separation of the two germanies der die oder das nutella what would be your advice for an english speaker learning german dude i just approved an idea of genocide and racism on china yesterday i really hate china and i started to understand what genocide means but in my case china is more of a godless culture which has never been through all those conflicts about religion dont get me wrong you westerns has been through christianity even if a majority of people dont believe jesus christ anymore i dont oppose atheists what i saying here is you will find it hard to believe that some of common values you think it is right but china think the opposite is right for example you think academic freedom is right one should be critical one should be reflective and china think one should be submissive and when one hold authority one should oppress others to make them to be submissive to authority figure this race this culture specifically is evil i am one of them in race i am taiwanese but i just dont agree with such evilness i mean you westerns will know such actions are wrong you may do it yet you may feel guilty and you may feel ashamed of it china wont feel ashamed of it china think it is how the world functions itself all those injustice they think it is justice or they simply dont have a so called idea of justice because their history is godless they submit to authority figure to survive they never know the meaning of freedom i dont germany atoned for its past unlike japan austria or italy  the return of antisemitism and the rise of afd are quite scary though i thought those demons had been laid to rest whats your take im french from alsace hi neighbour can you tell me why i cant say more than two sentences in a row in german after learning it for almost  years  im ashkenazic jewish and my family is still very scared of german people and inventions any words of reassurance  did you notice any changes since germany accepted a shitton of islamic immigrants i dont know what to feel i think thats okay its actually illegal to do hitler salute to show the hakenkreuz and other related things are illegal too  it has its reasons even if it restricts freedom of expression  but to deny the holocaust would be a lie  forbidding a lie is okay why would people in the us get angry if holocaust denial was made illegal i get that there are holocaust deniers in the us but its a very small percentage right great question mettbrötchen thats raw pork meat with raw onions on a bun still sad there is a lot of national guilt we have a lot of memorials and we learn a lot about it in school we watch original films or were scenes are recreated people die in that films we visit auschwitz  i was in primary school as i learned that the nazis killed hundreds of jews homosexuals and people with disabilities in gas showers im guilty about it even though i had nothing to do with it its still our past sadly yes we still have idiots like every other nation and sadly i seen some in my city doing the hitler greeting its illegal in germany but i think thats a minority a lot of people are against them we do our best i love liver sausages but my favorite is mettwurst and currywurst but i hate weißwurst as a person i love denmark because a part of my family comes from there or still live there as a german nice little country with nice beaches and humans still kinda sorry what we did in  to you no most germans think that the hate we get is reasonable and whatever japan gets is none of our business what do you mean justify the input  do you mean what money and space we put into justify the things we got out   yes we helped humans it was all worth it  but i dont speak for all germans some say the same some dont think so and the most are neutral no we hate trump and sometimes we think youre kinda idiotic   but you are more like the big brother who does drugs sometimes is in jail loves sports and bad beer but you like this brother because hes extreme cool my great grandfather fled the ddr the one ruled by udssr russia to the brd the other side the free side he had never seen his family again but he met my great grandmother and they fell in love built a new one  he never talked about his time in the war and later actually for a few years it went great but sadly there was an accident in colone köln were men sexual harrassed a lot of womens even though that the most men were german people said that this were the immigrants  after that a lot of people werent that welcoming anymore i dont think that the immigrants brought any negative change i just think there are a few asshles in  germans and a few asshles in  immigrants the rest are cool thanks for answering theyd still be angry freedom of speech how can you eat raw pork is it cured is it smoked ooooh yeah thats the right way fellow german you are not guilty dont blame yourself for something you have nothing to do with woah its illegal in germany thats a cool fact these sound delicious let me do some googling xd my son uk absolutely loves currywurst hes managed to obtain the sauce from the german deli shop in borough market london i agree that weißwurst is foul we all love going to the christmas markets but arent sure if theyll be running this year i appreciate your response thanks is it true that most germans think americans are moronic fat and beer drinking racists im so sorry to hear that bro definitely i do not deny the holocaust but i still think people should be able to for freedom of speech lying is still speech no its raw fresh meat you need to consume it on the day you eat it its so clean that its not a problem and then its shredded to minced meat what you can eat it i dont blame me im still feel guilty its our past we need to acknowledge it and its our job to prevent that it happens again no we just think you are ruled by one   we think that some of americans are that way but the majority is normal  i met enough people and seen people on tv that were the most loving and accepting persons  more germans think youre like in high school musical its a story a lot of people have similar ones it was a tuff time then but im happy that germany is no longer separated if everyone had to acknowledge and apologise for their past we would be going for ever time to focus on the future you have nothing to do with the actions of some idiots in the past you can say it happened but is is not onto you to act like you are at fault for it and somehow need to apologise you know its what they teach us  dont be a nationlist  dont be a patriot  dont show your flag  be sorry for the victims  show respect  dont call a dark skinned person black because it could be an insult  dont brag about anything german because if you do you get called a nazi thats stupid i am proud of germany there i said it you guys have amazing quality stuff and have added a lot of technology to the planet i can be proud of all the great things germany did like all the great cars and the new dual fluid reactor design oh thats nice to hear im proud of those things too but i never say or show it because its easy to get called nazi here are you a good witch or a bad witch what sort of spells do you know how do you get back into your craft when in a slump   i go through phases were i cant bring myself to do anything and ive found myself in one again never really found out what works for getting back into it hows it like being a pagan witch what are your thoughts about black magick im more starting out kinda but not really practicing much bc im more involved with other things but ive been super interested in black magick for years even when i was around  a bit of both almost all of them idk i just kinda do have you ever read anton laveys book the satanic witch what did you think of it  do you do much ritual magick  aside from salt and sage what would you recommend for cleansing  purifying my apartment i think theres something here that needs banishing hey not op but sandlewood is a pretty decent bet i havent read anton laveys book im

pointing finger to kinda claw him and make your hand a fist other methods include king konging itswinging at it ive tried its a skill that im still learning would you reccomend mastering this for a

or are planning on getting one how do i gather courage to do it are you gonna go for a  on the anniversary of the  attempt i usually would chicken out last second so i would end up with just a few minor injuries i also live with two other people and anytime ive actually gotten close to dying theyve found me before i did i have bpd which screws with how i see myself and makes me very impulsive its messed my lifr up a lot yeah ive been clean from self harm for a couple weeks now and havent seriously considered suicide in over a year ive just generally felt happier recently lol i havent really heard much of her music but she seems to be pretty good for me its whatever is easiest in that moment so usually the closest sharp object i did a couple years ago at a party and i hated it just not for me for me its just an in the moment thing and ive regretted it every single time even if it feels right its not and never will be no im done with that stuff i havent had a serious attempt in over a year and i want to keep it that way hope you find happiness soon and a path to recovery my dms are always open  when were you diagnosed yikes man bpd sucks i saw this post and im like hoh boy

everytime they hear about another attempt im glad  stay happy ive been weeks clean from self harm and its been over a year since my last serious attempt so im doing a lot better now than i have been in the past march of last year i hate it there are days where its just this constant self hatred and others where i see myself as this incredible person and it just makes life so much harder but im managing and im still alive so at least i have that why we got minus  its usually a mixture of fear that it could have worked and disappointment because i did it again congrats did you feel any different about yourself before and after the diagnosis lol well that shows they still care about you im a lot more forgiving to myself now because i know its not really my fault that im so sensitive i have a mental illness that causes it what shows do you like to watch the dark can call easy remember its not peaceful just an ending your energy needs a beginning and continuation the joy of release can be compelling i gave in after iraq the bullet went through my cheek and into the wall my buddy then fucked me up find a person any person one who will beat your ass they can jog your life and bring you back to reality you cant do this alone reach out im here ill listen and put you on your ass i dont watch much tv i cant sit through a lot though i guess i should find one any suggestions thats your problem you cant suck yourself into a better place i suggest  comedy  the office  chance that youll like it  family guysouth park you need to have a defined taste of humor  simpsonsfuturama just need to be able to switch from humor to serious fairly easily    dramatic  breaking bad if you dont like this idk what to tell you  westworld its a deeper meaning type of show so idk   thats all i can think of at the moment    movies can help too but idk what kind of movies youve watched already    edit jack rayan what vehicle do you own how much dick did you suck to get that position has the current pandemic affected your business sounds great how did you land the job owned a maserati ghibli worst car i ever bought sold it on after  months of ownership do you whole heartedly believe they are worth the premium also owned a  and that was a great car among alfa romeos what is the most common part that seems to require replacement im sort of thinking about getting a  in the future as a dream car but i havent heard too many praises in terms of reliability      then again some people refuse to change their oil power steering fluid or get a transmission flush so im not sure if what they claim is  true  ram rebel its actually not really something i was seeking outsooooo none i suppose yes and no ive been doing this for over five years now and i live in the midwest so due to weather summer is our busiest time of the year in past summers i think weve been a little busier but overall these people still have money and want to play with their toys so theyll pay to play and were still in the positive fortunately so when entering college i was looking for a parttime gig and found one as a parts delivery driver for the company had an incredible manager who saw something in me and was promoted to counter associate roughly a year later i was asked to take over the porsche brand and the year following came maserati and alfa lololol im sorry to hear that however i completely agree in regards to a maserati most of them are pos in my opinion and they lose their value faster than any car in production   out of the ones i oversee porsche is certainly my favorite and i enjoy them as vehicles  are awesome and porsche as a brand really has it figured out as to answer if theyre worth it maseratis are not at all if youve got the money for a porsche then go for it id certainly like to own one someday if the price was right lol im someone who is a big believer in preventative maintenance so for those that dont take care of their car well you get what you put in mopar owns alfa so from a maintenance perspective their a little pricy however out of all the ones i touch certainly the most affordable  alfas are very interesting to me because they made their us comeback in  and most of them are still covered under warranty the biggest problem im seeing on them right now is probably the engine radiator on the stelvios leak frequently however right now its covered under warranty so  as for the  itself thats tough as ive never actually driven one i hear theyre a ton of fun to track but if youre doing anything else in them it blows ive sat in them and theyre extremely uncomfortable and ive heard their suspension is incredibly stiff price point wise i think you get a better bang for your buck in the cayman however thats subjective to what youre looking for too nice  quite impressive good luck with your job  thanks for getting back to me the ghibli was a  in a silk blouse in my opinion the interior was just off the infotainment system was appalling and it wasnt particularly reliable  the  i owned was a  model and i loved it really was a super car for everyday needed something bigger so sold it currently drive a  very boring and have ordered an  started to think i shouldve got the new cayenne porsche in the uk depreciates fast though especially cayennes thank you yours too future mrms president yeah im just out on maseratis the only thing they have is their exhaust and the trident however it just doesnt seem worth the money  the new cayennes are beautiful imo and i think theyre pretty stellar cayennes are easily our quickest depreciator as well however between those and macans are our best sellers due to living in the midwest with the weather seems you where in the empire business welcome d why have you never used social media before this ama is invalid you have used social media now ive never had access to it it seems really cool so im disappointed i havent used it till now thats nice reddit has a reputation of being a super shitty and toxic site so its kinda a weird place to start if this is your first time here i recommend you stick to hobby or meme related subreddits anything to do with politics is incredibly cancerous  im curious why didnt you have access to social media until now i started on vk and found it fun so looked for other sites do you suggest any subreddits i havent had the money to buy phone or anything so i couldnt use these rpublicfreakout and rdataisbeautiful are both rather interesting in different ways i also like  rokbuddyretard however most of the humour there is extremely obscure and likely wouldnt make sense to someone unfamiliar with reddit culture theres a subreddit for pretty much every hobby out there hobby related subreddits are usually the most friendly rcasualconversation is also a nice place  overall it doesnt really matter what subreddit you go on as long as you actively avoid politics youll be consumed by athe hivemined very quickly after you spend too much time in rpolitics or rconservative thanks  it doesnt seem toxic here theres alot of kind people like you i also do this are we special can i learn this power i want proof can i harness your power yes you can but its extremly hard i dont run out of the room when i turn the lights off and i can bite icecream with my front teeth wow man so youre telling the truth yup but how tho  my secret is not running when i turn the lights off and biting icecream with my front teeth how do you resist  by not running and biting the icecream does emma uses reddit  yes thats what she said im terrified of rollercoastersdo you get scared and if yes is that the part you like is that the adrenaline how high was the highest one and do you go alone or with others where do you live have you ever been to cedar point if you jerk off on a rollercoaster will the cum splash into everyones face how many projectile vomitsvomits i used to be scared of any coaster that had an inversion until i accidently stepped into one now i am never really scared of it  main part i like about coasters is the feeling of speed and the gforces that work on you as the train works its way around the elements  the tallest one was red force and it was about  and got launced to  kmh to reach the top   some of them i went with family one of them i went alone i live in the netherlands and sadly enough have never been outside of europe yet  but hoping to do at some point but since i rode untamed and recently zadra i just love rmcs and steel vengeance is definitley on my list inertia my guy  kmh is  mph nice this isnt a question seek psychological help your are experiencing a symptom of a serious psychological disorder congratulations i think this is a good thing yea whats it called depression bipolar disorder and a host of others can cause your issue bipolar disorder tell me more about it im not a dr contact a dr okii holy fucking shit i i have all the fucking symptoms omg wtf wtf wtf wtf wtf hope its just my adhd have you seen babayoue is the white house haunted if so by whom and why what would a ghost be doing do you believe in ghosts and spirits craziest paranormal experience sounds cool  do you like to prank your friends when going to these haunted houses how do you find or hear about these places was there any places that was peaceful and calm instead of like scary do you film it have you been to winchester house what was your favorite place youve gotten to explore and what were some of the most interesting left behind things youve seen i always think its so fascinating to see ordinary items like textbooks in abandoned schools or whatever just forgotten by whoever left only seen in pics never gotten to explore are you religious if so do your religious beliefs interact with how you think about the paranormal and life after death you ever go down in the sewers   how deep is the deepest sewage youve stood in have you ever found dead animals other than bugs while exploring some of them i have no idea what that is tbh it is by an orange with a human shaped body and the mind of a baby nobody can understand how it got there ive honestly never been to the white house so i really couldnt say ghosting his ex ghost shit man ghost shit     in all seriousness i honestly dont know what they do i believe in ghosts but i am not sure if i believe in them more in the sense of sentient beings who used to be humans or some sort of nonsentient being who is just a memory implanted on a place yes if i didnt i wouldnt believe in haunted locations ive seen stuff and heard several things i think one of the creepiest was when i was alone on the third floor of an abandoned asylum i actually had permission to be there and the person who let me in was long gone i entered this room that was dark and almost right away heard someone whisper near my ear help me no if my friends come with me which is very rare i dont mess around the one time i was caught and every time ive almost have been caught have been because of others lots of googling and driving back roads very occasionally hearing something from another explorer or even civilian oh yeah a lot of places are very peaceful i know an old lockmaster house near a river and its just a great place to sit by the water most times yes most times yes never been to california or generally out west other than new mexico mildly and honestly they dont to me its two separate worlds its babayoue you dont know babayoue lmaooooooo this right here is gold people do explore by yourself and what happened after had any ghosts appear on camera nope and neither does google lmao i just get redirected to a band when i google it generally yes very rarely ill take some friends and some haunted locations only open up for public hunts i ran out of that room haha i had to pass by it several times because of its location but nothing strange happened there again no at one point i thought i caught something but it was a resolution thing tricking me have caught voices though do the atmosphere of creepy places not scare you are these videos available to view they do but getting to explore places is way more fun than any fear my yt channel is called travelwithaustin theres one whole video dedicated to a creepy evp i got at an old prison also some from a hospital but those are less clear have you run into homeless people or thugs living in these abandon places in what is now probably hundreds of explorations ive seen two homeless people one place had evidence of a homeless person but i never saw them got caught by the police for trespassing nope only been caught once and it was by the owners of the place and it wasnt getting caught so much as my friend telling them we were there thats a huge accomplishment  is it true what they say about the senses of taste and smell being dulled by smoking did those senses get stronger again after you quit and if so what was that like congratulations i quit recently too but now im vaping    are there any scenarios where its hard for you to not smoke like when drinking with friends who smoke etc nothing to ask just want to say congrats how hard was it to stop how long did you quit previously you said twice and whats different this time congratulations man so many people get lung cancer from smoking so i am glad that you quit damn man im trying to quit but its so fucking hard im  weeks cigarette free    although that luekmia diagnosis made it easy  congratulations 🎉 how did you finally manage to get yourself to quit do you ever regret smoking i currently dont smoke nor plan to smoke anytime soon  but i want to hear your thoughts on if smoking would be worth trying for the first time while running the risk of getting addicted to it thats really nice to hear congratulations  question do you feel that your health has improved congrats im not a smoker myself so dont get how addictive this habit can be i really want to help my mother in law to quit though she says she wants to but then i dont see her making any steps towards quitting she had cancer few years back and survived and even stopped smoking for a year or so but then started again any advice you can give on how i can helpencourage her to quit or do you think its not possible thanks did you go cold turkey yes you go go go i believe in you  table of questions and answers original answer linked  please upvote the original questions and answers   question  answer  link  thats a huge accomplishment  is it true what they say about the senses of taste and smell being dulled by smoking did those senses get stronger again after you quit and if so what was that likeit is true but ive only felt slight difference if any really my senses of smell and taste have always been particularly strong even while i smoked so i wouldnt say they were being too dulled during the last couple months before i quit i couldnt help being almost grossed out by the taste of the smoke which is what contributed greatly to my decision to quit i still smoke pot so i guess maybe thats why i dont notice any significant change in my sense of  congratulations i quit recently too but now im vaping   are there any scenarios where its hard for you to not smoke like when drinking with friends who smoke etcnope not at all for the first couple of days after quitting ive had reflex thoughts about lighting a cig while sitting at my computer mainly because thats where i used to smoke the most while gaming however it was just a habit to grab a cig whenever id finish typing something or when id complete a game objective or get killed ie whenever my hands were free and whenever i could safely shift my attention away from the screen  like i said this habit was gone after a few days and ive never had an urge to light being alone or with friends who smoke more to the point the smoke started bothering me and ive asked all of my friends most of whom are smokers to sit by the window while smoking i now tend to avoid the company of tobacco smokers especially if theres more of them smoking in  nothing to ask just want to say congratsthanks a  how hard was it to stopvery easy after i realized im not actually addicted to nicotine but only had a nasty habit smoking pot helped me realize this and helped me quit every time id have a joint i didnt feel the need to have a cig for a couple hours afterwards so two years ago i just said fuck this shit im finishing this pack  more cigs left and never lighting a smoke again and i  how long did you quit previously you said twice and whats different this timefirst time i tried quitting by gradually reducing the number of cigs i smoke per day and it went really slowly it took me a month to go from one pack to  cigs a day but i wasnt very determined about it i guess so i quickly returned to burning up a whole pack a day  one year after that i decided to just cut it down to one maybe two cigs a day and it worked for a week but again i wasnt very responsible and being single with a lot of free time on my hands i spent hours in front of my screen which made me smoke more every day so again i was at a pack a day after only two weeks  another year passed and i literally tell myself what an idiot you are and just quit because i knew i wasnt hooked and didnt wanna allow my irresponsibility to go that far so basically the difference between the  two times and the last time was just realizing i could have quit for good  two times if i wasnt  congratulations man so many people get lung cancer from smoking so i am glad that you quitto be honest i was well aware of all the risks during these  years and it didnt stop me from poisoning myself i only quit because i was fed up with the nasty taste in my mouth and throat as well as my fingers awfully stinking not to mention having to pay for it all  thanks a  damn man im trying to quit but its so fucking harddo you have your reasons for quitting defined if so what are they  also why do you find it so hard to  im  weeks cigarette free   although that luekmia diagnosis made it easy  congratulations 🎉thank you  im very sorry to hear about your diagnosis i had a little niece who suffered from leukemia  years ago hope youll get better  how did you finally manage to get yourself to quitafter quitting twice and starting back again i basically had a short conversation with myself and decided that i never should have started in the first place and if i dont quit now who knows how much more time and money itll cost me before i do i was also fed up with the nasty taste in my mouth and throat as well as the nasty smell of my breath and fingers the stench of smoke getting into everything in my room etc  another reason i forgot to mention was setting an example for all my friends who constantly moan about needing to quit but never do as well as my mom who smokes more than a pack a day for over  years now and keeps telling me she should quit but cant make herself  do you ever regret smoking i currently dont smoke nor plan to smoke anytime soon  but i want to hear your thoughts on if smoking would be worth trying for the first time while running the risk of getting addicted to ithell yes if i could turn back time id literally beat myself for even starting i was a dumb kid back in the day when i started high school i had to move into a boarding school up until then i was still under control of my parents but once i was away from home it was like setting a wild animal free from a cage i was  and influenced by my own ego as well as other people around me i still remember the first couple of weeks i smoked for the heck of it a few cigs a day when offered by my atthetime friends i didnt like it i didnt need it i just thought id fit in easier because most people smoked i wish i knew back then that i would never fit in which is true  i honestly dont see anything about it thats worth trying its nasty smells bad ruins your breath your fingers stink your clothes stink your hair stinks nothing good comes from it not to mention its literally toxic the warnings on the packs are not exaggeration  smoking kills and causes not only cancer but other nasty diseases too its just a money making scheme for the rich industrialists to get richer by making over a billion consumers worldwide poison themselves willingly not even gonna go into what httpsenwikipediaorgwikinicotinepesticide causes  do yourself a favor and experiment with cannabis instead of wasting time money and health with tobacco  thats really nice to hear congratulations  question do you feel that your health has improvedi definitely have a higher lung capacity now but thats about everything ive noticed thats changed for the better healthwise no more coughing out nasty stuff every morning     httpsgithubcomjohnsliaoamacompiler it is true but ive only felt slight difference if any really my senses of smell and taste have always been particularly strong even while i smoked so i wouldnt say they were being too dulled during the last couple months before i quit i couldnt help being almost grossed out by the taste of the smoke which is what contributed greatly to my decision to quit i still smoke pot so i guess maybe thats why i dont notice any significant change in my sense of taste nope not at all for the first couple of days after quitting ive had reflex thoughts about lighting a cig while sitting at my computer mainly because thats where i used to smoke the most while gaming however it was just a habit to grab a cig whenever id finish typing something or when id complete a game objective or get killed ie whenever my hands were free and whenever i could safely shift my attention away from the screen  like i said this habit was gone after a few days and ive never had an urge to light being alone or with friends who smoke more to the point the smoke started bothering me and ive asked all of my friends most of whom are smokers to sit by the window while smoking i now tend to avoid the company of tobacco smokers especially if theres more of them smoking in group thanks a lot same congrats g very easy after i realized im not actually addicted to nicotine but only had a nasty habit smoking pot helped me realize this and helped me quit every time id have a joint i didnt feel the need to have a cig for a couple hours afterwards so two years ago i just said fuck this shit im finishing this pack  more cigs left and never lighting a smoke again and i did first time i tried quitting by gradually reducing the number of cigs i smoke

gonna go into what httpsenwikipediaorgwikinicotinepesticide causes  do yourself a favor and experiment with cannabis instead of wasting time money and health with tobacco products i definitely have a higher lung capacity now but thats about everything ive noticed thats changed for the better healthwise no more coughing out nasty stuff every morning too i dont think its impossible evidently shes shown shes able to quit but i dont have any good advice to offer to someone whos already managed to quit for a whole year except just do it again its obviously a choice she was once able to make so i dont see why she wouldnt be able to make it again from what youve said it seems to me she just says she wants to quit but is either not determined enough or doesnt really want to quit either way good luck to both of you  yes yeah i get that that was the hardest part for me finishing a game and not going outside to light up lol thank you awesome thats nice i saw you mentioned that you were single when you tried quitting are you now in a serious relationship do you think that played a role in motivating you mostly depression and addiction runs in my family im tired of coughing and my staminahealth has clearly deteriorated over the last  years i was doing good before the pandemic maybe  cigarettes a day because i cant smoke at work but being stuck inside all day hating life and my apartment i just habitually smoke all day when im with the gf i try not to smokebut then i get irritable after like  hours i hope she is well the average age of s person with this type is over  so the odds are definitely better for me congrats bro i used to smoke indoors much worse the smoke lingers for a while the smell just gets into everything it was awful  you mentioned vaping by the way ive had dozens of coworkers switch to vaping last year it was literally a rage where i work they were all so proud of themselves for it going nonstop about how its less harmful yadda yadda yadda even tho they were all basically using cheap crap manufactured in china and paid about  or so with crappy flavors etc after about two or three months i see them all back to regular tobacco i was in a relationship until a few days ago i quit before we started dating but even if i didnt quit before i would have quit then since she had asthma and could not stand being in the same room with someone smoking and yes dating did play a certain role in my wish to quit because i dont wanna date people who smoke so i cant imagine why any nonsmoker would wanna date me making out with me would taste like kissing an ashtray i see depression and addiction are not strange to me even some of my family members are affected by both furthermore where i live most people smoke so its a very common occurrence even for young teens  you nailed it with habitually right there youre just like i used to be smoking because youre used to and now because you have a lot of free time on your hands i wouldnt say youre addicted otherwise youd be struggling every day because your work only allows you to consume  cigarettes a day  all you gotta do is stop buying make a goal like i did  finish the pack youve got on you and tell yourself im finally done with this fed up with the stench the awful taste the coughing all of it fuck this nasty shit  for a few days whenever you think about lighting up with that thought in the back of your mind telling you that you need it just counter it by telling yourself no i dont i just think i do im not gonna tell you to regain control over yourself because you already are in control this isnt an addiction to nicotine this is a nasty habit you can just kick trust me youll feel much better without it and everything that comes with it plus youve got your girlfriend to support you with it i didnt have much support  all of my friends are heavy smokers if shes not a smoker which im assuming she isnt judging by what you said about trying not to smoke around her shell appreciate you more and be proud of you sadly she passed away after a few months of therapy it was a rare type she was  years old thanks yeah ive never been a fan of smoking indoors and yeah alot of people where i live vape and i started in order to quit cigarettes but now im just hooked on another form of nicotine hopefully going to quit the vape soon though i am definitely addicted to nicotine my mother smoked around me ever since i was born as well as when she was pregnant drank as well   i agree with you that its a big mental thing but im just not right mentally especially stuck at home im looking for a new job because of covid so hopefully once that happens things will get progressively better   the thing is when i am with her or doing something that takes my attention i can easily ignore the cravings as i am distracted or doing something that takes my attention its this quarantine thats fucking me right now   and drinking ha thats so not fair  im so sorry do you feel the need for the nicotine and how would you describe it ive never genuinely felt like i had an urge for the stuff sometimes just lighting the cig would feel as a relief and i wouldnt even finish it my mom smoked before she had me then quit when she got pregnant and started smoking again after she stopped breastfeeding me dad never stopped smoking i grew up in a household with them and dads father smoking and almost any male relatives or friends that ever came visiting smoked it was what normalized it for me  i now view it as a trashy thing im not an attractive guy and id turn down a literal sex bomb only because shes a smoker a huge no for me  you say being distracted and working helps you not smoke good find more distractionshobbies make sure whatever it is it helps you from even thinking about lighting up also try replacing cigarettes with weed i dont mean that like replacing one addiction with another but in my case weed has helped me a lot since i had no urge to smoke a cig for up to a few hours after smoking a joint life isnt fair most of the time im sorry she had to go through all that too as well as her entire family and countless of others young or old who die from unnatural causes  thank you for your sympathy hope you kick your cancer in the butt i have some rage issues so for me it usually feels like im on the verge of flipping out and i take a few hits and it subsides im trying to find a better way to control my anger rather than using a harmful substance at this point im not even sure if its helping or if im so used to smoking when im mad that my brain thinks hey i feel better now i smoke a lot of weed as well the kicker i love spliffs if i have weed i wont even smoke a cigarette because ill smoke a spliff but its still consuming tobacco and nicotine so its more like a bandage on the wound rather than actual treatment   also i smoke so much weed costs too damn much haha ill burn an ounce in a week or less it may very well be an actual addiction but it may also be just a coping mechanism and taking a few hits has a placebo effect  ive been hearing all my life that people smoke for stress relief so naturally whenever ive been angered id light up to calm myself down but id never really felt like it helped me well damn bro an ounce can last me up to a month you need to cut that down too lol we both have somewhat of an addictive personality but we cant let our addictions dictate our life choices and lifestyles again going to work i cant smoke weed everything has gotten higher in consumption since lockdown i am planning on moving at the end of the month hopefully and a change of scenery i think will help my mental stability good luck hope everything turns out well for ya'"
