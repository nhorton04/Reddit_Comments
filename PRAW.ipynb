If you decide to take part, you will be asked to read a short profile of a psychological care provider, fill out some questions assessing your attitudes about the profile, and to answer some basic questions about yourself. The entire study will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes. \\n\\n**Eligibility Requirements:** Minimum age requirement of 17 years, living in Canada.

I am requesting your assistance with a study for my Honours thesis in psychology with CQUniversity, concerning public perceptions of exonerees through crime and evidence types. You must be at least 18 years of age to participate and due to the nature of the content, you must not have been a victim or known a victim of violent crime. This is because participants will be sorted into a group that will be given either rape or murder scenarios. The scenarios are based on real cases, however, identifying information such as names, dates, and locations have been changed. The survey is expected to take approximately 20 minutes.  \\nThe survey is anonymous and confidential since no identifying information is collected. Participation in this study is completely voluntary, so if you do not wish to participate do not feel pressured to. You may withdraw participation at anytime until the survey is complete, as once it is complete there will be no way to identify your results.  \\nThank you.',\n",

(qualitative) i would really want to spend more time on my literature review to solve this issue, but my college has an impossible to keep up with timeline, so if anyone is aware of a suitable theory/model or even a better suited variable than resilience, (bc i can't find a lot of references linking resilience and activism, but there are others like burnout) it would be of great help! thank you :)\",\n",

       " '\"The findings of the mediational analysis demonstrated that degree of perception of purpose in life significantly explained the relation between satisfaction with life and suicide ideation. These findings have theoretical implications for models of psychological well-being and for the prevention of significant psychological distress. Specific support was provided for Frankl’s contention (Frankl, 1971, 1985) that one is unlikely to attain life satisfaction by directly pursuing happiness or subjective well-being, but rather that such positive outcomes might ensue from the intentional pursuit of meaningful tasks, experiences, and attitudes. The mediational findings suggest that improvement in psychological functioning might be achieved by clinical interventions targeting perceptions of meaninglessness and lack of meaningful pursuits in addition to dissatisfaction with one’s life. Research evidence indicates that positive emotions can significantly improve problem solving, enhance emotional well-being, and reduce suicide ideation (Joiner et al., 2001).\"  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Purpose in life significantly moderated the association between depression and suicide ideation and was most protective against suicide ideation with increasing levels of subjective depression.

And this is where the onesided direction becomes selfconfirming and fatal - because the prisoner MUST do this if he wants to survive, but it will never the less be in vein, even though for his \"best\". He needs to obey, to do the work, to endure the torture, to accept his being a prisoner to maximize his survival chances. But at the same time his efforts are not changing the circumstances causing his misery. If we were to draw any conclusions from that then that he should change his strategy. He should aim to change the circumstances, because no matter how good he copes with them, they will always throw him back as long as they persist. Sometimes one has to take risks for a greater good in life. \\n\\nSo here comes now your top to bottom direction which seems very strange to me - \"The heightened levels of uncertainty and angst trigger our [amygdala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala) which in turn reacts in one of two ways: fighting or fleeing. \\\\[...\\\\] This obviously makes little sense in times of global turbulence when solutions are beyond our grasp.\" Here you literally say \"you can\\'t change anything and you even shouldn\\'t fight or flee, rather ignore your primitive instincts and become an instinctless rational sheep\".

Yes, she surely would feel better. And i assume people following your advice are pretty happy to sacrifice every now and then someone who does the dirty \"top to bottom\" work for them. \\n\\n  \\nSo what have the people gained by ignoring their instincts and following your advice? Surely, a pleasant, comforting and boring, moral, \"good\" life, where everyone is happy, boring and average. But what do you think brings more power, vitality, happyness, purpose and meaning in life - to fight, to flee or to become a modern sheep - obeying morality, politics and reason? \\n\\nIts not the global turbulence and uncertainty that makes people sick - its the inability to fight or flee because of our modern day pleasures and lies - democracy, equality, wealth, even capitalism. Sheeps love capitalism (and what should they else do?) and capitalism loves sheeps - win-win!

They also have trouble recognising emotions in the faces of others. I do not know the answer to if they feel joy, I would imagine they do even feel satisfaction.

They can do it but its effortfull and is mostly used as a tool to manipulate. But the term psychopath is actually very vaguely defined and a lot of the measures for it are contested.

Meaning that regardless of someone's IQ or measure of inteligence, the actual amount of time spent each day thinking about a specific big problem has very little relation to your ability to think fast, as often it's the reverse, long and arduous thought that actually comes to the correct answer.\\n\\nIt would be logical to assume that the more time egnaged in deep thought in a subject you're interested in, you would actually experience time passing faster since your perception of time is preoccupied by your work. Where as someone who was given the challenge of thinking about a big problem in a complex manner but is not invested in the actual problem, would experience time passing slower due to a number of factors drawing their attention away from the subject and onto other things with the sole purpose of passing the dragging time.\\n\\nWhen you look at people like physicists who have provided answers to some of the biggest questions ever asked, they didn't spent decades using fast thinking to solve small problems to get the answers, even though they are capable of doing that. They spent years constantly obsessing over and thinking about the same big problems until they cracked it, and these are examples of arguably the most intelligent people to have ever lived.\\n\\nAt least to me, it would be reasonable to argue that the perception of the passing of time is relative to the size of the problem being solved and interest in the subject, especially within the higher echelon of levels of intelligence. Give someone 100 small individual problems to solve and time might pass more slowly due to their ability to think fast.

       " 'Like all biological determinist research, [this study](https://sci-hub.tw/https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.1330) suffers from a host of problems that render any conclusions based on it regarding the possible genetic basis of specific psychobehavioral traits unwarranted. Below, I will discuss some of the problems I noticed based on a cursory review, in no particular order. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nFirst, it is important to remember that there is no reliable scientific evidence that specific psychobehavioral traits in humans have particular, consistent genetic underpinnings. What the available evidence instead shows is that, rather than biology, these traits derive their specific features from sociocultural and political-economic (environmental) factors. According to the evidence, biology merely serves as a *general* potentiator of psychology and lacks a *specific* deterministic, or even \"influential\" role in this regard. Indeed, virtually all psychological traits (e.g., self-concept, emotions, motivation, memory, perception, sexuality) exhibit culturally-specific features. \\n\\nIn line with this, given that the author \"take[s] an evolutionary perspective\" and hypothesizes that \"concealed mating evolved as the norm in humans\" (p. 2), which is to say that he assumes this norm is biologically determined, his findings are dubious. In [*Macro Cultural Psychology: A Political Philosophy of Mind*](https://www.amazon.com/Macro-Cultural-Psychology-Political-Philosophy/dp/0195373545), cultural psychologist Carl Ratner elucidates why biological determinist theoretical orientations in the social sciences, such as evolutionary psychology, are untenable:\\n\\n>It takes thousands of generations for genetic changes to accumulate via a sufficient number of organisms’ out-reproducing other organisms to produce a new morphology. Yet humans have produced **only 100 generations since the founding of the Roman Empire**; this is **not enough time for new morphology to genetically evolve**. And **human behavioral change does not involve morphological changes** in genes, neurotransmitters, or cortical structures, which obviates genetic evolution’s pertinence to human behavior at all. **Naturalistic theories of human psychology such as** ***evolutionary psychology*** **are false**. (p. 89, bold and italics added)\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nSecond, the study relies on surveys, which are generally unreliable due to complications including the [social desirability bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_desirability_bias#:~:text=In%20social%20science%20research%2C%20social,bad%22%2C%20or%20undesirable%20behavior.) and [order effects](http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/social-psychology-research-methods/order-effects/#:~:text=Order%20effects%20refer%20to%20differences,materials%20are%20presented%20to%20them.). In fact, the author admits that, \"Since informants are often reluctant to discuss their sexual lives . . . sexual aspects are often poorly documented,\" and that \"informants may not practise liberal sexual behaviours in\\nthe presence of anthropologists that come from cultures where such behaviours are strongly disapproved of.\" While he states that \"sufficient ethnographic data on the privacy of legitimate mating were found\" (p. 2), he apparently fails to elaborate on the criteria that qualify this data as \"sufficient.\" These limitations and weaknesses are clearly considerable and do not exactly inspire confidence in the author\\'s findings. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThird, the author states that \"[w]idespread human behaviours are strong candidates for evolutionary adaptations\" (p. 2). However, this claim is misleading. In order to consider whether specific psychobehavioral traits are biologically determined evolutionary adaptations, it is insufficient that they be merely widespread: They must also be universal. This is because a) biologically determined traits in species do not exhibit cross-population variability, and b) widespread, historically-specific sociocultural and political-economic factors can potentially account for widespread behaviors in humans. Even so, just like correlation ≠ causation, universal ≠ biological. Indeed, correlational evidence, such as that presented in this study, lacks the power to establish causation. As I explain [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/f9u6os/sex_based_differences_between_male_and_female/fzyzurb/): \\n\\n>In order to determine whether some variable (x) causes another variable (y), y causes x, some third variable (z) causes both x and y, or the association between x and y is merely incidental, experiments are necessary. This is a basic principle of research.\\n\\nWhile this research may certainly *suggest* genetic underpinnings to this \"concealed mating\" norm, it by no means confirms their existence; that is, it does not amount to reliable scientific evidence that such underpinnings actually exist. \\n\\nIt is scientifically irresponsible to conclude a genetic basis to widespread, or even universal psychobehavioral traits prior to investigating and ruling out possible environmental causes. I explicate on this point [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/cx5rrh/many_genes_influence_samesex_sexuality_not_a/ezujdrs/) with regard to homosexuality, but it equally applies to all other psychological traits (psychosexual, or otherwise):\\n\\n> your main problem here is in conceiving behavior in abstract, general terms. This gives the impression of \"universality\" when there in fact may be none. In [*Vygotsky\\'s Sociohistorical Psychology and its Contemporary Applications*](https://www.amazon.com/Vygotskys-Sociohistorical-Psychology-Contemporary-Applications/dp/0306436566), cultural psychologist Carl Ratner discusses why this is problematic:\\n> \\n> >In contrast with physical abstractions which provide essential information about gravitation, floatation, waves, and gases, abstract psychological notions about thinking, memory, feeling, and learning are rather barren. Psychological abstractions usefully indicate the general aspects of human activity—especially in contrast to animal behavior—however, they never reveal its particularity and variety. As Clifford Geertz (1973, chap. 2) argues, generalities such as \"man thinks,\" \"man is moral,\" \"man enjoys beauty,\" \"man has kinship systems,\" \"man uses language,\" \"people have a sense of time,\" \"humans categorize information,\" are neither false nor unimportant. However, they fail to disclose the richness of the concrete, particular instances from which those generalities are derived. (p. 116)\\n>\\n>. . . \\n> \\n> What we know for certain is that specific, concrete psychobehavioral traits exist. So, Occam\\'s razor would select for this conception of traits (as concrete) in favor of the notion that traits falling under some abstract category are materially related. In order to support this latter claim, scientific investigation into the matter is necessary. As Ratner continues:\\n> \\n> >. . . we cannot assume a more general level of explanation until more specific levels have been systematically ruled out. If specific socio-technological factors can plausibly account for psychological phenomena, it is unwarranted to postulate universal factors. For example, the Trobriander Islanders\\' sophisticated logical inference can plausibly be explained by their complex system of property rights and legal negotiation. If their logical reasoning is found to be comparable to modern Americans\\' (which, we must emphasize, has not been proven), the explanation would lie in comparable formal features of the two social systems—i.e., in their individualized form of property allocation and their legal system of arbitration (the Trobrianders\\' legal system having been imposed during their colonial period by the British and Australian governments). Psychological similarities between the two peoples should not be attributed to abstract, universal social features unless the formal features can be shown to be insufficient explanations. (Ibid., p. 118)\\n\\nThe author, while interestingly listing qualitative variations in \"concealment\" (p. 3), nevertheless relies on an abstract conception of this behavior and fails to systematically rule out possible environmental confounds. This further testifies to the unreliability of his conclusions. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nFourth, the author compares human behavior to that of non-human animals. However, as I elaborate [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CuteLittleButts/comments/ardr3o/butts/egnli7x/), such comparisons are fallacious (specifically, they are [category errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake#:~:text=A%20category%20mistake%2C%20or%20category,could%20not%20possibly%20have%20that)): \\n\\n>we cannot make any reasonable conclusions about human behavior based on animal studies. This is precisely what stimulated the [humanistic movement within the field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_psychology), which took issue with behaviorists\\' reliance on animal studies. As humanistic psychologists note, behaviorists downplayed, ignored, or even outright denied unique aspects of human behavior, such as our free will and desire/capacity for personal growth. Humans are the only species capable of abstract and symbolic cognition, as well as the only one able to organize complex societies. Unlike in other animals, specific human behaviors generally have sociocultural rather than biological origins. Aside from things like the diving and suckling reflexes, humans do not have \"instincts,\" so to draw conclusions about human behavior based on studies of species that are largely instinctual would be what\\'s called *overextrapolation*.',\n",
