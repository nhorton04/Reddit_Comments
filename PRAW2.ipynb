That means, aside from a couple of safety guidelines, that students can do anything they want with the equipment.

Yet, anyone who can merely demonstrate in vitro efficacy against Sars-Cov-2 can justify getting a clinical trial running - the exact kind of unwarranted shortcut in our traditional evidence-based medicine process that gave us drugs like HCQ...\\n\\nThe idea that we can actually slow/prevent/reverse age-related disease phenotypes by targeting aging biology is the next frontier of medicine - it is only a matter of time until the medical dogma that \"we can\\'t do anything about aging\" is upturned.

Chen et al. found that HSCs from old mice showed increased activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling compared to those from young mice. Intriguingly, inhibition of mTOR with the drug rapamycin *reversed aging-related declines in mouse HSC function and enhanced the ability of old mice to mount an effective immune response to infection with influenza virus.* The authors thus propose that manipulation of mTOR signaling may lead to therapeutic approaches to restoring aging-related declines in HSC function.\\n\\n> **Although rapamycin has been used as an immune suppressant in transplantation (23), treatment with rapamycin during infection can *paradoxically* induce a more effective memory T cell response (31)**\\n\\n**\"[TORC1 inhibition enhances immune function and reduces infections in the elderly](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/449/eaaq1564?utm_campaign=TrendMD_1&et_rid=34837226&et_cid=2176392&utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc)\"**\\n\\n> **low-dose TORC1 inhibitor therapy in elderly humans decreased the incidence of all infections, improved influenza vaccination responses, and up-regulated antiviral immunity**. Thus, targeting the TORC1 pathway that regulates aging may have clinical benefits for elderly humans including improvement in immune function and decreased infection rates. \\n\\nAnd another *Sci Transl Med* paper demonstrating its effects on ameliorating immunosenescence to improve influenza vaccination response:\\n\\n**\"[mTOR inhibition improves immune function in the elderly](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/scitransmed/6/268/268ra179.full.pdf)\"**\\n\\n> **RAD001 enhanced the response to the influenza vaccine by about 20%** at doses that were relatively well tolerated.\\nRAD001 also **reduced the percentage of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes expressing the programmed death-1 (PD-1)\\nreceptor, which inhibits T cell signaling and is more highly expressed with age. These results raise the possibility\\nthat mTOR inhibition may have beneficial effects on immunosenescence in the elderly.**\\n\\nLow-dose rapamycin has also demonstrated significant reductions in the incidence of RTIs such as from coronaviruses (non Covid-19) in a [Phase2b trial in the elderly](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/2efab205-5689-453e-b2c6-5bdb006d89d4), including [reductions in the incidence of severe symptoms by ~50%](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/4e5cdc45-cc2b-4d9a-815f-4907690bb06f)\\n\\n**\"[Age-related decline of de novo T cell responsiveness as a cause of COVID-19 severity](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-020-00217-w)\"**\\n\\n> **So far, little attention has been paid to the link between immunosenescence and the dramatic mortality rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in older age groups**. Indeed, the number of cases of COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is very low among children and teenagers, in contrast to the increased frequency in adults and the elderly, who are also more at risk of developing very serious symptoms and death (Guan et al. 2020; Wu and McGoogan 2020).\\n\\n**\"[Aging immunity may exacerbate COVID-19](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6501/256)\"**\\n\\n**In this paper published in *Science*, immunologists call for strategies to address COVID-19 using therapeutics that target aging.**\\n\\n> Aging is associated with increased morbidity arising from a range of tissue dysfunctions. A common denominator of age-associated frailty is increased baseline inflammation, called inflammaging, that is present in older individuals. Recent studies have shown that the presence of excessive inflammation can inhibit immunity in both animals and humans and that this can be prevented by blocking inflammatory processes. This finding has important implications for the immunity of older individuals who are infected with pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that induce overwhelming inflammation, which can be fatal, particularly in older people. Reducing inflammation may be a therapeutic strategy for enhancing immunity in older people.',\n",

Roughly 6000 applicants came from California in 2019-2020, while only 1600 came from Georgia. \\n\\nWhile population alone matters (ie, more people in California means more applicants), it seems reasonable that the culture in such areas could play a role in people's desires and motivations to apply to STEM.

Thank you.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nMy question:\\n\\n##What tangible and real things are You doing to fix this?\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Background:** I dedicated 2 years of my life to building an Engineering program for underrepresented and underserved people in STEM and tech.\\n\\nI had a phenomenal team of other volunteers who helped, but they stayed 1-2 quarters before moving on (typical turnover rate). A handful stuck around and were hired.\\n\\nA core part of the curriculum was the intangible skills such as persistence, resilience, curiosity, grit, opportunity identification, and others. These were taught through mentorship and a carefully crafted program that hid them under the surface of hardware engineering, design, and entrepreneurship. \\n\\nI forwent pay for those two years so that we could put more money into the program and because I wasn\\'t doing it for money. I was doing it because I hope to send off generations of global leaders in tech and business. Individuals who embody and perpetuate the ideal dream that we are all reaching for.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Why I ask the question that I ask:**\\n\\nI did not start volunteering at the nonprofit to \"save\" people. I did it because I knew and grew up around East Palo Alto from the 80s-now and I always like to expand people\\'s worlds. So many people I hung out with from there never saw STEM or the high tech jobs that were right next door as an option. It just didn\\'t exist in their world. Also, I did it because I was fortunate to be raised by parents who raised me in a multicultural community where there was never a question of \"diversity and inclusiveness\", it just was. My first experiences with the fact that the world didn\\'t run that way was when I stepped out of that community and it made me sad to see and determined to push us towards that ideal.\\n\\nI\\'m particularly good at the Full Stack of engineering, leading, and building. When the admin team at the nonprofit saw how I worked and was able to do every aspect of what we were doing they asked me to build the engineering program as I saw fit. I was super stoked.\\n\\nIt was immediately a wild success, and from 2018-2020 over 500 students came through the doors of that program alone and many volunteers from google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Apple, and even the military R&D teams.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nBUT\\n\\nI saw so many more people come and join and immediately assume an administrator role. They were too good to clean up or take out the trash. They rapidly \"rose\" to a role that didn\\'t require them helping people directly, and instead allowed them to \"delegate\" or do outreach, things that you do need a handful of people doing, but not so many.\\n\\nTo me it seemed like it may have unconsciously become a nice \"accolade\" or resume item but not so much an opportunity to truly and profoundly impact each and every life that came through that door.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen this many other places as well.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nTo me, the students (ages 5-90) see the way we act and interact with our environment, and when they see that we have ownership of our building, engineering design lab, equipment. When they see that we put in countless hours to keep things clean and nice and such that the students get the best experience every single day, it communicates to them in profound and deep ways. When we don\\'t have that ownership, they respond to that.\\n\\nIt has always been a mantra of mine \"We leave the place as good, if not better, than when we got here.\" My students learned that and would be given time to clean up and reorganize after a night of classes. The other tracks in the program didn\\'t do this, their volunteers didn\\'t do it, and it came clear through how people felt about each respective track. To me, **the leaders need to be willing to sweep up too.** \\n\\nLook no further than Doug Jones and Joe Reed for examples of people who were too high and mighty to \"clean the toilets\" or take out the trash (those come from prior interviews by Gimlet Media\\'s Reply All team)\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\nMy wife is Latin, Native American, and Caucasian. I am a mixed mutt despite not looking like it.\\n\\nOne of the first things she told me was that it was the mentors that she worked beside and who encouraged her who truly and profoundly impacted her life, who were the ones who put the idea that she could go into a STEM field into her head and ultimately lead her to drive towards a PhD (and get it).\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIn the midst of our personal and professional pursuits, her and I have voluntarily and proactively done outreach events, ranging from demonstrations to presentations that have gone incredibly well and touched communities who don\\'t typically get attention from people from scientific, engineering, and entrepreneurial backgrounds.\\n\\n**We both feel that it\\'s imperative to have the people promoting diversity and inclusiveness in STEM also acting to make it a reality, and not just being a figurehead that\\'s good at getting attention** (although that helps).\\n\\nYou can imagine my personal frustration at how many who are good at getting media attention aren\\'t actually spending the time on the front line making it a reality (again, don\\'t get me wrong, those people are a crucial component but, what do those children-to-adults think when they see a figure head who isn\\'t the one doing the work. What message does that send.)\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThree last items for clarity:\\n\\n1. The communities I was working with simply needed encouragement and the door to be open to them. They are super smart, innovative, and talented and the local companies like Facebook, Google, etc really need to genuinely help them get their foot in the door.

As an ecology PhD candidate with 7+ years of teaching experience in biology (and geology), I've often thought about the low amount of representation POC have in upper division biology classes and higher ed. as a whole. The vast majority of minority students I've taught are on track for medicine in some form or fashion, which is great! Unfortunately, that leaves the more natural and research-based fields of ecology and evolutionary biology woefully underrepresented by POC. Lately, I've tried to figure out how we can improve this representation at the University level, but I've come up short; I don't think any level of outreach or encouragement in freshman or sophomore level classes will help. In my experience, the issue to me appears systemic: many white biology students benefit from the privilege of being able to seek degrees without as much concern for future financial outlooks (studying something that interests them rather than something that obviously benefits them), they are more often raised in environments that facilitate contact with nature, and they are often exposed to a wider diversity of biology-related subjects in lower ed.\\n\\nMy three questions are: 1) am I wrong in thinking this is a systemic issue, 2) can I (we) be doing more at the University level to encourage pursuit of advanced research-based degrees in ecology and evolutionary biology by POC, and 3) if #2 isn't feasible, what can I (we) do for outreach and where is this outreach best targeted?\\n\\nThanks in advance!\",\n",

First, because so many faculty  in certain STEM fields are from immigrant backgrounds, I have heard some concern about immigrant scientists not being able to mentor BIPOC as effectively. One argument here is that such immigrant scientists may not understand the BIPOC experience in the U.S. - not having grown up and gone through U.S. schooling, for example. Second, however, I have also observed immigrant faculty draw on their own experience of being outsiders to become very effective and caring instructors of BIPOC, inviting them into intergenerational research groups in STEM, funding them to go to conferences, and the like. So this is a complex and important issue, and one that merits more attention.',\n",
       " \"Hi, Yasmiyn here. I agree with Anne-Marie that this is a really important question. Because researchers generally focus on either race or immigration status, we actually know very little about students' experiences at their intersection. Additionally, to  u/sinenox's point, studies focused on racial experience in education often rely on traditional racial and panethnic categories that mask the unique and at times divergent experiences of racialized subgroups within these categories. [In my own research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26413559/), I find that teachers' ratings of student academic ability and behavior vary at the intersection of race, ethnicity, and immigration status.

For Asian students, we tend to see a lot of East Asian with less representation from Southern Asian countries and almost no representation from certain cultural groups whatsoever (Hmong, Mien, etc). \\nMany US colleges target students from these countries (India, Korea, Japan, China) and overall facilitate the process of acquiring an F1 (international student) visa. As you can imagine, the process isn’t easy nor cheap so usually students from developing countries such as Thailand don’t have the resources to study in a US institution. \\nThere is also historical examples of the US recruiting already educated, middle class, tech workers from S.

For example, many of the early contributors to knowledge development in fields like chemistry (e.g., Robert Boyle) and geosciences (e.g., Charles Lyell) espoused racist viewpoints - that non-White people were non-human, less intelligent, and could never become as intelligent as whites. And yet, science is often portrayed as objective and separate from social history and identity. A first step to improving diversity in STEM fields is acknowledging that the development of STEM fields is intertwined with social assumptions that do not recognize, and even denigrate, the perspectives of BIPOC. Efforts at multiple levels need to take place. Understanding the role of social identities a in relation to scholarly development is a critical departure point. Mentoring that encourages students from diverse backgrounds to see themselves and feel a sense of belonging as scientists, is key.\\n\\nEfforts have to be more organizationally and institutionally focused as well. All scientists need to take responsibility for diversifying scientific fields - that responsibility should not just fall on people of color. This requires time and effort in transforming mindsets. Doing reading and participating in professional development opportunities about culturally responsive teaching -- and applying that knowledge in the classroom and in mentoring - is important. Raising the visibility of the contributions of non-White scientists in coursework,  physical spaces, media, and other settings is also important to provide images and role models in which BIPOC students can see others like them who have thrived as scientists. Ensuring that BIPOC scholars are on conference panels, nominated for awards, are reviewing scholarly articles, is critical. Graduate admissions practices that rely on more expansive criteria about the potential to contribute to science can enable more BIPOC to access such programs in the first place. In the U.S. there is considerable institutional stratification, so mutually beneficial partnerships with Minority-Serving Institutions can also channel more BIPOC students to supportive graduate programs.  \\n\\nSome scientific associations in the U.S., like the American Geophysical Union, are engaging in these efforts as well.

BIPOC are disproportionately young, thus they are going to constitute more and more of the workforce that will keep the U.S. economy going. One constructive and realistic framing is to see BIPOC\\'s opportunities and those of white people as a \"both/and\" not \"either/or\" - as interdependent. For example, given that whites are disproportionately older, as whites age, they will need more and more qualified people to take care of them with regards to STEM-related issues like health.

It is not uncommon for one person to be the \"champion\" and leader of such efforts, and if they change positions or get other responsibilities, they can\\'t keep the efforts going, and there are no other resources to keep the efforts going.

At the graduate level, those responsible for admissions should not hold it against students that they might not have participated in internships or research opportunities that these schools did not have the resources to provide. Similarly, undergraduate admissions should take a more expansive view of the potential of BIPOC students to contribute to scientific fields, rather than focus on narrow (and inaccurate) metrics like test scores. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDepartment faculty and leaders can make special efforts to fund BIPOC students to attend professional conferences like SACNAS [https://www.sacnas.org/](https://www.sacnas.org/)  Faculty can make special efforts to connect BIPOC students to their networks - it is often through these personal connections at spaces like conferences that students might meet the first scientist from a background like them. In other words, connecting BIPOC students with inter-institutional networks and professional associations focused on BIPOC students can provide other avenues for fostering a sense of belonging as scientists. Culturally responsive pedagogy that takes into account role models, histories, and perspectives of BIPOC is also key. What this can look like is incorporating reading and exercises about these issues in science classes, rather than assuming that they will get covered in social science, ethnic studies or other classes. So much emerging scholarship has connected STEM with social issues, and incorporating this scholarship into curricula would provide more opportunities for students to see themselves reflected in the coursework they take. Right now I am working with a large network of Hispanic-Serving Institutions that are very involved at the department level in raising attainment of BIPOC and Latinx students. They are engaged in practices like peer tutoring in introductory classes, intergenerational research groups, and strategic mentoring of graduate students to apply for NSF fellowships. These institutions graduate higher shares of Latinx students than the average institution in the U.S.  This initiative (website below) provides an example of departments that take a multipronged approach with many strategies to expand opportunities for BIPOC students:\\n\\n[https://cahsi.utep.edu/about/](https://cahsi.utep.edu/about/)',\n",

       " 'This is Anne-Marie - your question is very wide ranging, so I am going to answer just a bit of it toward the end. Obstacles for BIPOC students include that they are more likely to be first-generation college-going students (I believe this is true in the UK as well as US), from low-income backgrounds (similar in US and UK), with family caretaking or employment responsibilities. Developing targeted internship and work opportunities on campus in STEM fields for first-generation and low-income students so that they do not have to work off campus to finance their educations can help them engage more in STEM fields and get the mentoring that is particularly helpful to them. Being more flexible in the timing of when students can take tests or do their laboratory work can also support students who have to work elsewhere for employment or take care of their families. Providing equipment ranging from donated business wear for job and internship interviews to disciplinary \"gear\" like outdoor clothing (for geoscience students going on field trips) to electronic equipment- computers, laptops - to complete assignments. Universities and employers vary in the quality and quantity of their efforts to build capacity to address such challenges, but most have at least some active efforts going on. In the U.S., universities and colleges differ so much in terms of resources, and this condition affects the level of support that students at those institutions receive. Some less well-resourced institutions would like to do much more to support BIPOC students, but  simply are limited in terms of financial and human resources. Legal issues are also a factor. For example, in U.S. public universities in states where affirmative action by race/ethnicity has been banned, personnel at those universities may be prohibited from focusing on BIPOC in STEM attainment efforts. By contrast, well-funded selective private institutions do not experience such legal constraints and typically have the resources to support students. On the whole, while not all U.S. selective private institutions may prioritize efforts for BIPOC in STEM, they (among all U.S. institutions) certainly have the most financial and human capacity and choice to do so.',\n",

CAHSI has the bold goal of raising attainment among Latinx in computing to 20% of the share of computing credentials by the year 2030.

Many students who have participated in these conferences tell me that they have been able to interview with employers there and received internship or job opportunities. With such conferences, computer science and tech employers have the chance to go to a place where advancing BIPOC is prioritized, and where connections with BIPOC students and faculty can be facilitated. \\n\\nConnecting with these and similar initiatives can offer chances for more focused recruitment of students who have had access to internships, research experiences, supportive mentors, and culturally responsive teaching. More broadly, reaching out to Minority-Serving Institutions including HSIs, HBCUs, and Tribal Colleges and Universities can offer avenues to recruit tech and other STEM talent.

The underrepresentation of BIPOC  is a systemic issue in the U.S. Earlier in their lives, BIPOC are often not exposed to fields like ecology or geology, either in the K-12 curriculum or in extracurricular pursuits (for example, going camping with their families prior to college). And in other fields like biology, BIPOC families may be more exposed to professional (not academic) opportunities in those fields, and therefore favor opportunities like professional school. In my research, I have personally talked with BIPOC students whose families would financially support them to pursue biology degrees with an eye toward medicine, but who would refuse to financially support the pursuit of geosciences. So exposing BIPOC students, families, and communities to the expansive opportunities in these fields early on, before college, would be an important systemic effort. And when BIPOC students do pursue say, ecology, it is important early on in college to connect then with research opportunities and mentors who can provide them with academic and interpersonal support to stay the course. Bridge programs that prepare BIPOC students in STEM coursework prior to college, and that later on prepare BIPOC students to apply to graduate school, can facilitate systemic transitions toward higher levels of education.

Or as a better analogy that we haven’t wiped out tons of species of frogs, insects, and other animals through habitat destruction because another member of the genus exists in frozen embryos.  Hardly anyone is vaccinated for smallpox anymore... off the top of my head I can’t think of a single place it’s still done.  The last case we know of was in Bangladesh in 1975.  But smallpox is an exceptional example.  Very few viruses are both as stable as smallpox that vaccinations remained effective and also that it is a virus that can only propagate in humans.  Almost all other viruses have different enough serotypes and strains that no single vaccine is effective for all  long enough to eradicate the virus.  Polio is tenable maybe...  most of the world is free from polio but it still pops up in countries with poor access to vaccination programs.  Smallpox is a monster... but because it was our (humans) monster, we could eliminate it.  We are no where near eliminating anything with zoonotic populations the pathogen can survive in between human outbreaks.  Look at rabies.  We have very effective vaccines (no real treatment besides inducing a coma and hypothermia and relieving cranial swelling and hoping the patient eventually fights off the virus before  they die... but that’s worked... what... twice?) but there isn’t even an attempt to eradicate it because we can’t immunize all bats, racoons, hell... most pets aren’t up to date on all their rabies shots.  So I mostly agree with you that we are not good at eradicating diseases... but smallpox is literally the exception to the rule... demonstrating just how special a disease must be in order to be eradicated.\\n1. Horrifying... massive fatality rate (~30% by some estimates I believe) , highly contagious, and high morbidity in survivors who were scarred for life at best.  This means that just about everyone chose vaccine despite risks.  \\n\\n2. No zoonotic reservoir to hide in... humans were it’s only friends.\\n\\n3. Stable enough that all serotypes were recognized by antibodies which the body of most produced upon exposure from the smallpox vaccines/ and even crushed up cousin cow pox scabs smeared on a cut.\\n\\n4. A massive multinational, multi decade, enforced vaccination program that included vaccinating people without consent.\\n\\n5. No close relatives with mutative tendencies to fill the niche left.  Yet.\\n\\nSo a very rare and special case can be eradicated by implementing vaccinations in a way that would never fly today.

Consciousness is, roughly speaking, the \"stuff of awareness,\" whereas mind emerges when this consciousness exists in a highly organized state. To use an analogy, consciousness is to mind, as bricks are to house. One would never say that bricks emerge when bricks are suitably organized, but one would say that a house emerges when bricks are suitably organized.\\n\\nThe problem here is our generally physicalist worldview. The thrust of science has typically been to try to explain various physical phenomena in terms of more fundamental physical phenomena. But consciousness and mind are not purely physical phenomena, and therefore cannot be explained in purely physical terms.\\n\\nIn order for a hypothesis of emergence to be valid, it is necessary to be able to actually explain the emergent property in terms of the properties of the thing it emerges from. So, for example, we can explain the wetness of water via the properties of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms from which water is composed. But in the case of consciousness, there is nothing in the physical properties of matter which could cause consciousness to emerge, regardless of how complex, integrated, or any other way that matter is arranged.\\n\\nIf, however, it is raw consciousness itself which underlies all reality, if matter and the physical world are actually in a sense \\\\*made of\\\\* consciousness, then it would be the case that arranging matter in various ways would necessarily also cause raw consciousness to be arranged in corresponding ways. Furthermore, there would be certain arrangements of matter which would correspond to arranging consciousness into mind.\\n\\nThere is a hypothesis of \"mathematical psychogenesis,\" ([https://scionics.org/aedoc-matheism-and-psychonics/](https://scionics.org/aedoc-matheism-and-psychonics/)) which states that the mathematical nature of consciousness is such that raw consciousness spontaneously arises or exists wherever the truths of mathematics are true; since mathematical truth is true infinitely throughout space and eternally throughout time, raw consciousness is infinite, eternal, and omnipresent. This is \\\\*raw\\\\* consciousness, not mind. This infinite, eternal, omnipresent raw consciousness forms a plenum (a gapless field) which we can call the \"psychonic field,\" for lack of a better term.\\n\\nMathematical psychogenesis goes on to state that, due to the mathematical and hedonic nature of raw consciousness, this psychonic field individuates itself into individual \"nodes\" of consciousness, which we can call \"psychons,\" each of which manifests physically as a Planck unit of spacetime, and each of which is part of a single, infinite, eternal \"psychonic network\" of all other such nodes. The psychonic network serves as the matrix from which all physical reality emerges.\\n\\nMathematical psychogenesis solves a number of heretofore intractable problems in physics and philosophy, such as the ultimate foundation and cause of all reality, the nature and relationship between mind and body, and the underlying reality which lies beneath and explains quantum phenomena.',\n",
