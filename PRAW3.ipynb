       " 'The clangs of metal rang out loud. The air was filled with the smell of iron. Cheers and jeers filled the surrounding as waves of men clashed.\\n\\nFor some reason, the sun had hidden itself under a thick dark cloud. A slight darkness covered the field, dulling the shiny metal armour worn by most of the men there – lying down or otherwise.\\n\\nAs time moved slowly, the lines of men that had clashed began to diminish steadily. It seemed as if a balance was about to be reached, when suddenly special units of both lines were deployed to certain gaps in the line. Mounted knights began to charge and leap towards their adversaries, wiping out many in powerful dashes. Tall, powerful bishops raised their staves and maces before taking the plunge themselves – chanting their sacred oath to God that empowered them. Then the Rooks took to the field, they moved slowly yet could bulldoze the enemy at a terrifying rate.\\n\\nBloodbath ensued. It was a terrible yet somewhat elegant sight to behold.\\n\\nAmongst the chaos of the battle, the grunts of the armies had dwindled to mere handfuls. They were called pawns, in name and all. The special units would almost always use them as impromptu shields, even ordering them to charge the enemy in suicide missions just to safe themselves. If a pawn were to stay at the camp, they would do so dutifully. Knowing that to be sent to the front would only mean in pointless death.\\n\\n\"You there, Pawn 6?\" asked a woman, her features were powerful and exuded greatness.\\n\\n\"Your Majesty, Pawn 6 had been... sent to the front!\" said a pawn nervously.\\n\\n\"Ah, very well. Then I shall have you accompany me. Please inform the King that I had taken my leave!\"\\n\\n\"As you wish, My Queen!\"\\n\\nThe Queen galloped her horse with vigour. It was as if the horse had taken magical pellets, for one could see that it practically glided through the field. The Queen swung her mighty sword and crowds of men were sent flying like crows. It was truly a sight that would awe anyone.\\n\\n... and then there was the pawn. The pawn who had been ordered to accompany his Queen had lagged behind significantly. It was true, a horse could make a man travel faster and further. But in this battle, a pawn would never move in any rate the special units could. This particular pawn simply took his time and checked his tools whilst biding his time.\\n\\nAfter spending some alone time, he began to notice the pile of dead men strewn around. Some of them had died in tragic ways, whilst others had still some life in them if only barely. The pawn had no time to mourn the dead. He was on a slow yet steady mission from his Queen. If he were to stop now and took his time, the battle might\\'ve been over.\\n\\n\"You there, pawn!\" the Queen yelled as she looked back in a mad-dash, \"come and join the slaughter!\"\\n\\n\"Y-Yes, Your Majesty! I would be there as soon–\"\\n\\nAn arrow. A fallen horse. The Queen simply froze.\\n\\nIn a flash, the pawn had seen his liege fell lifeless to the muddy ground. The sight was truly unapologetic. In battle, no one is exempt from death.\\n\\nWith burning rage, the pawn rushed as fast as he was physically could to the enemy line. He sneaked a glance at his dead Queen and took her aura for his own. A jolt of lightning had struck him and empowered him to made a suicide charge.\\n\\n*This shall be the hill that I would die on, for Her Majesty!* He thought loudly as he charged through the enemy line, taking several to their graves.\\n\\nThe pawn felt blood on his sword, the smell of iron overwhelmed his senses. The rage had sent him to near-blindness, only allowing him to focus on the enemies in front of him. As the enemy regrouped and tried to finish him for good, he dodged them by going further into their lines. When the pawn had come close to the enemy King, everyone\\'s focus shifted to blocking his path.\\n\\n*Fools, the lot of them!* He spat out with a grin.\\n\\nBut as soon as he thought so, a flash struck him down. Thoughts of death and his Queen flew in and out rapidly. He had done his duty and was ready to accept the consequences.\\n\\n\"It can\\'t be...\"\\n\\n\"Impossible!\"\\n\\n\"K-Kill it! Kill it before it does anything!\"\\n\\nHis enemy cowered in fear. They began to move in for the kill. Something had changed. They were no longer only there to protect the King. A primal instinct of eat or be eaten had taken over everyone in the vicinity.\\n\\n*Huh?* The pawn opened his eyes and saw the same field as he had earlier, *A-Am I dead?*\\n\\nJust as he started to process everything, the enemy came after him, weapon in hand. They began to hack, slash, and bash their way to end him where he had stood. Though for some reason, the pawn glided around them with no problem at all. In fact, he felt a surge of power flowing in him. A gentle caress whispered, \\'kill their King\\'.\\n\\n*I think I can do just that!* He exclaimed, preparing for a final charge.\\n\\nBlood. A stream of red warm blood.\\n\\nA hundred men fell down, yet a single person did not. It was a massacre.',\n",
       " 'Sara Lazuli knew her place.  She was a pawn.  She moved forward, for there was no retreat for a pawn.  She smiled bitterly as she struck down those in front of her.  Sometimes a knight or bishop would zip ahead, and do their thing, killing those who opposed them, but in the end when there was danger, they would be allowed to retreat behind the line.  Not Sara, not for any pawn.  They moved forward and hoped not to die.  \\n\\nAnd at the end of the road, or so the legend says, a pawn can become anything they wish.  Sara wasn\\'t sure she believed that.  A carrot to dangle in front of the powerless.  As if there was anything more than moving forward.\\n\\nMaybe it was because she wasn\\'t motivated by such flights of fancy, or maybe it was just dumb luck, that Sara found herself deep behind enemy lines.  The fighting was behind her, but that was no concern for a pawn.  She just kept going, always forward, one foot in front of the other.  \\n\\nShe saw it then, the end of the world.  Was this what they were fighting for?  This sheer cliff leading to this void? What was the point? Whatever, forward always forward...\\n\\n\\\\*RUMBLE RUMBLE RUMBLE\\n\\nAs she approached the void something was approaching from the west, something fast.  Sara would have laughed if she weren\\'t about to die.  An enemy rook was charging her way.  Oh well, she had done pretty good as a pawn.  She closed her eyes.\\n\\n\\\\*CRASH\\n\\nDying was a lot more boring than she thought it would be.  Less painful too.\\n\\n\"MOVE!!!\"\\n\\nSara\\'s eyes snapped open.  A knight stood between her and the rook.  He had taken the attack meant for her.  \"Move, into...the end!!!\" he coughed, crimson spilling from his lips.\\n\\nSara had no time to question, no time to thank him, no time to mourn him.  She would honor him by doing what she was meant to.  She moved forward. Forward into the end.\\n\\nAnd she knew.  She was not at the end because an end is just a beginning when you turn around.  A pawn that can turn around, she laughed as the darkness seeped into her, could go anywhere.  She would move forward, but she would choose what was forward.  \\n\\nQueen Lazuli stepped from the darkness.  The rook still shaking the knight\\'s corpse free from his spear.  He had time to look her in the eye, to recognize the pawn from a moment ago.  He was still looking her in the eye as his head was separated from his body, the obsidian sword not so much as slowing down as it went through his neck.  \\n\\nSara the pawn always moved forward.  But now Queen Lazuli could decide for herself what was forward.',\n",
       " ' Blood and sweat coursed down his neck and chest, mixing with dirt as he crawled through the mud. His helm was dented, and pushed against his left eye, swollen from a gauntleted fist he never saw coming. His head rang with the impact of steel, and the iron tang of blood filled his mouth. \\n\\nEran was a dead man walking, or in this case, crawling, and he knew it. But goddamnit he had a family to get back to, so he kept crawling in the ravaged war scape that had once been a green field, flush with life. An arrow shaft stabbed into his side, stray bodies pierced with iron and steel broad heads, and the smell. Death. He knew it well. When you were a veteran, an elite, worth a score or more lives, you were inducted into the order of the pawn. It had been a proud day. It hadn’t mattered before the charging savages. He’d been caught underfoot, trampled, and forgotten. A bitter stroke of luck as his brothers in arms were extinguished. When you could fight a thousand men and come out alive, you were inducted into the order of the Bishop. A member of the Rook could destroy five thousand. And the sole member of the order of the queen was nigh unstoppable. \\n\\nTo a man like Eran, that was unfathomable power, inhuman. The kind that made regular soldiers put their head down unless it drove them mad. They were monsters, every single one of them. Benevolent perhaps. Allies perhaps. But they were. Not. Human. When they could reap human flesh like wheat, lives became just another stepping stone to power. It was said an ancient sage had blessed the orders, giving them power to protect their nation. It had worked too. Until the savages. \\n\\nEran’s head swam. His eyes darkened. Strange twisted legions of creatures had arrived. Flying beasts of fire and brimstone, lurking giants, green skins fleet of foot and blade, with carnivorous teeth. Men and women too, clad in strange clothing and wielding strange magics and powers. Sometimes their blows were like leaves, other times the smallest creature could gain strength beyond comprehension. It was like the cruel rolling of a dice, or perhaps a wrathful god of luck. The antithesis to the careful orders and legions of Eran’s home. \\n\\nBut there was a chance. Bit by bit, the dying screams of his country men faded, the monstrous roars and screams faded. And as he crossed the final line of battle, he felt his tired and broken body start to shift. He lay back his head and closed his eyes, taking in the power he had feared, prepared to lose the humanity he saw absent in the eyes of the high orders. And when he opened his eyes, the world was different. His skin was hard as marble, and time itself lost some of its hold on him. He rose complete once more, blazing with power. The order of the Queen had welcomed a new member. \\n\\nIn a bound he landed amongst the horde that had broken his line, and cleaved thirty in a single slash, their crude iron armer splitting before his blade. His eyes blurred with euphoria at the sheer power coursing through his limbs. He had been weak before. Worthless. But now he had purpose. He could kill. And take REVENGE. He had power. Blood splattered in arcs around him, as he grinned wildly tasting the blood of others for the first time, and enjoying it. A man with a great metal shield braced in front of him, and Eran slammed his sword through the shield, cleaving the man in two. There was a brief resistance, and then the number 12 floated above the mans head, before his body fell into halves. Perhaps there was a look of betrayal on the mans face. Perhaps their god of chance had failed him. Eran didn’t care. He had slaughtered a dozen in the time the dead man uttered his final gasp of shock. But in the midst of slaughter something tugged, clawing at his mind. Eran spun around, and saw golden glow over the castle he had originally been fighting to protect. Now he only desired blood, but his own power tore at him, fighting against his desires. So when the massive pillar of light struck down from the heavens, his body was the one burned to ash. For although he was a Queen, there was also a King. The bonds that gave him power also bound him to the throne, and as the clash of battle continued, tales of life and death beginning and ending, one more village would be empty.',\n",

       " \"It was a wonder just why the wars existed. Lines were drawn up, battle plans laid, formations mustered and lives lost to the thundering cannon and clashing swords. Surely nothing came of this?\\n\\nBefore him, Milos considered his [options](https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Kosovo-1389-Balkans). The armies behind him were routing and encircled, his own King protected by royal knights and armed bishops, desperate to keep the struggle alive. His queen had died valiantly, saving their King in a desperate gambit. \\n\\nForward then. \\n\\nEnemies had tried and failed to check Milos's advance. Somehow he had fought, bloodied, all the way beyond the edge of the battle where the enemy Sultan hid. Here, on the plains of Kosovo, this pawn would make his mark on the war. Knocking aside an enemy Knight, Milos stole his horse, and charged at the Sultan. \\n\\nDesperate pawns threw themselves at him to no avail. Milos danced about them, from right to left and back again. Distantly he heard fewer sounds of battle, no allies could reach him here. It was Milos alone, with the Sultan before him. \\n\\nAs he drew his blade and struck the eneny King down, it occurred to him that pawns were as capable as any other at killing Kings. Perhaps that was why they were treated this way.\",\n",
       " ' 14.\\n\\n14 was the number of people a Pawn could get away with killing before they themselves would fall. Nobody knew who created the rules, only that they were absolute: the greater your ranking, the more you would be capable of in life. Pawns were the most plentiful, and also the weakest. I knew not what the upper limits of the other Pieces were, but my own limits were burned into my mind, by some greater, unknowable power.\\n\\n14.\\n\\nI had the power to bring low 14 other pieces, and then I would expire. I only had a black tabard to denote my rank; unlike the other ‘Pieces’, as we would call them, Pawns had no adornments. Kings and Queens had crowns, Bishops wore their helmets, and Rooks boasted their pauldrons, and all of them swept through fields of Pawns like we were nothing. Adornments were the source of the other pieces powers, as well. You did not have to kill a Knight to best him, for example; simply flinging him from his steed would render his power inert, making him no more useful than a peasant or slave. It was this rule on which I based my plan.\\n\\n2. \\n\\nI learned that I did not have to directly take a Piece in order for it to count against my total. See, I had a plan, and it worked. An enemy Pawn charged past me, just as his commander, a Rook, took aim at me. I had searched deep into the rules, and found a latent power amongst Pawns, called En Passant, that allowed me to dive and slay the Pawn that had passed me up. As I did, I felt the counter toll once, then twice, as the Rook barreled past me, taking out my Bishop. This sacrifice, I deemed, was what counted as my second Piece.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nI was able to take out four more Pawns before the enemy forces overwhelmed our unit, as we knew they would. Their King was simply too smart for us, was able to read our own moves even better than our own King could. When they came, I grabbed my Bishop’s helmet, and was captured. The enemy Pieces all thought the same, that I was the Bishop, surrendering. They quickly sold me into slavery, where I toiled, far from the battlefield.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nI could still take eight more pieces in the name of my King, but as a slave, I was unarmed. I became a chef, honing my cooking skills for my masters.

       " '“I didn’t.”\\n\\nI watched carefully at the strange man in front of me. His clothes lay in tatters about him, almost comical. He had sustained a head wound, one that had laid him in his grave mere hours before the Apocalypse began. No one talked about it, but we’ll all knew it. \\n\\nHe raised a hand; I flinched slightly until I realize he was just scratching the wound as it began to heal, the scars and blood disappearing. I could swear what I saw was makeup, like a VFX prosthetic from a movie in the 2000s. But it wasn’t.\\n\\nThe mans skin did not have the pallor of death about it as it had a mere few minutes ago. I, for one, could not believe that it had worked. It was a split second decision. My life was on the line as he approached. \\n\\nDumbly, I was blindsided until I heard the low grumbling of a not quite sentient being. His hands extended towards me, his long brittle nails scratching at the air, the cuticles receded. My eyes had darted about. He was closing in. Slowly but surely. I had no weapon, not even a sharp stick or rock nearby. \\n\\nWhen I was a child, I was quite a biter myself. I bit everyone, save for it that hand held food. A hand holding food in a chain mail glove standing 5 feet away behind a blast shield. Yeah. \\n\\nI eventually did grow out of the behavior, mostly. If I was scared, I would shut my mouth quick and clamp my jaw tight. And here tonight, was one of those nights.\\n\\nI didn’t expect anything to happen. Maybe the slimy asshole would flee, or scream, or at least get distracted enough for me to escape. But it did something entirely contrary to my fundamental understanding of Zombies. They were, or perhaps are,  corrupted humans who are technically dead to medical science but are alive in the most primitive capacity. They reflect the most primitive of urges in us, without even a voice. They made simple grunts, growls and groans. And this one had awakened those primal instincts in me.\\n\\nIn my jaws, I felt the stringy muscle and sinew become firm again. I let go when I heard a shriek of pain from the being, not the growl of a zombie but a real human scream. The pain receptors were the first to come online, again a part of our most primal programming. \\n\\nHe looked at me, at first angry, noting the chunk of flesh bitten from his arm. I spat it at the floor. But that piece of flesh did not matter as I watched his arm regenerate. And then reason hit him, higher brain function coming online now.\\n\\nHe began to sweat, falling from his half cocked position to a kneel. I heard his breath whoosh in and out, the first few breaths in years. That must have felt good. \\n\\nHis skin, once deathly white and purple and green, pinked and lightened. His face reddened was the rush of blood flooded his extremities. He doubled over, coughing and hacking. He spat. Blood.\\n\\n“How did you know that would work?”\\n\\nHe asked me again.\\n\\nI shook my head and shifted in place.\\n\\nHe looked at me, his eyes pleading. He marveled at the new skin of his hands. He touched the wound on his head as the skin grew anew. He scuttled off nearby and looked at his teeth in a shard of metal. The gums were pink and firm. The teeth didn’t rattle and regained their whiteness.\\n\\nHe looked back to me as if to ask me a question.\\n\\nI knew what he was wondering.\\n\\n“I was always a biter.”\\n\\nEdit: grammar',\n",
       " '\"How the hell did you know that would work\" the man asks through a pained gasp.  \" I didn\\'t\" i respond through stained red teeth. The man and I shared a soft smile. We both knew we had been through so much.What an odd time it was back then to be a cannibal. With a humble grin and a soft chortle I go back to taking bites from the newly healed flesh. Thank goodness it healed, rotten flesh is killer on the gut. \\n\\n\"OH GOD NO! WHY CHRIST!? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS! NOOOO! NO NO! I\\'M ALIVE AGAIN PLEASE NOOOOO! \" The man cried. What an odd time to notice his mechanics name tag. mmmm..Paul. Pauls alright without the usual mayo and lettuce.\\n\\nThe man seemed exhausted from healing which made holding down this newly acquired snack seem relatively easy. The hunger from surviving began to subside as the large mouthfuls of paul began to satiate the hunger. Paul finally became quiet as i lifted the remains and draped his arms around my neck like a backpack, and on my way i went. Taking playful nibbles from the exposed fingers as i made my way towards a setting orange sun.',\n",
       " '\"How the hell did you know that would work??\" The zombie gurgles out. I didn\\'t respond. Like a familiar smell in the air at the grocery store I was brought back to an earlier time. I knew I had heard these words before. Yes! We came across that group of zombinals and I swear we heard one of the zombies start talking. Them focks really figured out you could eat zombie if you boiled it in baking soda. How many did they... never mind. \\n\"Dude, hello wtf is going on,\" the now very much more human looking zombie manages. Hmmmm, buddy seems fairly chill. \\n\"Hey what\\'s up man, you tried to kill me, which I mean, fair, you were a zombie. But then I bit you cus I ran out of options and figured teeth count as weapons for Valhallas sake and then you got all humaney again.\" \\n\"Well shiiiiiiiiiiiiiit, I feel great and really hungry you got any ughhahdjfjdjjdjsjs\" the manbie lurched out while crumpling to the ground. As the manbie vomited up what I can only assume arn\\'t cow eyeballs; I pondered the ramifications of what just happened. Funk, I\\'m gonna have to bite so many zombies. Wait no, I\\'m the saviour. I returned their humanity so they must do the work to return others humanity. \\n\"Hey dude once you\\'re done I have a little something for you, this is big, we\\'re gonna change the world\" I say to the heaving manbie. \"arghghgglllllll\" \\n\"Yeee I\\'ll give you a minute.\" I take a seat and pour myself a nice 12 year scotch. Idiots never scavenged the liquor stores. Everyone\\'s always about \\'water\\' and \\'being aware,\\' but I like to have a little fun with the apocalypse. \\n\"Where am I?\" The now pretty much human dude barked out. \\n\"California,\" I replied.\\n\"Where in California?\"\\n\"30 outside San Francisco\"\\n\"This is not thirty minutes outside San Francisco\"\\n\"Not minutes, days. \\n\"Shiiiiiiiiiiit.\"\\n\"We gotta start turning zombies back into humans dude. We will create an empire! It\\'s perfect, I\\'m 55, you\\'re like 20, so I can be the supreme ruler of humanity for a few more years and then you can take over sooner than you know it without any assassinations needed!',\n",
       " \"The next thing I knew I was sitting up on my makeshift bed, my heart thudding in my chest. I'd experienced some crazy dreams since everything went down, but this was by far the craziest. The idea of me biting an actual zombie was both disgusting and hilarious, since before the zombie apocalypse I was the type of person who wouldn't eat raw fish or didn't even want to look at a steak if it wasn't well done. When civilization returned to normal, if it ever did, that would not change. In fact, considering all the gore I've seen since, I  might go one step further and go vegetarian or vegan. I'm already halfway there since decent meat if a hard thing to come by right now. \\n\\nBut the dream, despite it's absurdity, was terrifying. I had experienced far too many close calls like that since the pandemic began. The first rule of zombies is to never, EVER, let yourself get boxed in or cornered. The key to survival is to keep as much distance between them and you as possible. If they can't get close to you, they can't bite you. Period. All those who were all keyed up for close combat with those things were the first to get ripped to peaces or bitten and turned. \\n\\nShaking off the remnants of both sleep and the aftermath of the dream, I got up and began to face the day and whatever came with it.\",\n",
       " '\"How the hell did you know that would work?\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt was a good question, it really was. And I wanted to answer it. But even if, I could have, I wouldn\\'t have been able to. No, I was to busy working my way through the rest of the horde that had followed behind him. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI don\\'t remember how many I had to bite that day before I got to safety. Zombies are not generally polite enough to let you stop and count. I was so scared once I found a spot to hide, how many zombies I managed to chomp down on wasn\\'t exactly the first thing on my mind either. It had to have been quite a few though, since they were able to form a new resistance group, fighting back against the plague for humanity. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI don\\'t know if it was a coincidence that the first man I bit back to life was the one who found me, or if he had been deliberately looking for me. Either way, just a few days after becoming human again, he came climbing down into the basement that I was hiding in. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"You\\'re bite made me immune, I think,\" he told me. \"After I came back, they just sort of ignored me. Now me an some other regenerated are helping some scientists work on a cure while we clear out the rest of the city.\"  \\n \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI couldn\\'t believe what he was telling me. It all seemed like a dream, but there he was, in the flesh, the living, breathing flesh; telling me I could help rebuild human civilization. How could I say no? All I had to do was keep biting.   \\n\\n\\nIt was hard at first. The taste of rotting flesh isn\\'t easy to stomach. But I had no choice. Street by street, we moved through; the taste stopped making me vomit after every bite. Building by building, the smell of decay became less of a burden. Room by room, the thrill of a mouth-full of human flesh began to grow. Zombie by zombie, I had to wonder what ever bothered me about it in the first place. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow, there are hardly any zombies left to bite. I spend a lot of time just sitting here in my apartment, looking down at the people walking through the streets that were once crowded with the undead. A woman walking hand in hand with her young daughter. A man walking his dog. A group of soldiers walking down the sidewalk. It\\'s been so long since the soldiers were needed, it\\'s almost surprising to see them. Normal life for just about everyone had returned. I should be happy. But no matter how much I tried, I just couldn\\'t be. \\n\\n I almost miss the days when I had to run from shelter to shelter, praying to god that one of the undead hadn\\'t spotted me. When I\\'d come across another survivor, it was terrible not knowing if they would betray me, kill me in my sleep for my food. Every second lived back then was a second lived in terror. I almost miss it, but...I don\\'t. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow, I have more to worry about in every waking second than I ever though possible back then. Because what I truly miss...What I don\\'t know if I can go on living without...is the taste of human flesh. I miss it and it\\'s...unbearable.',\n",

The water was still, and none but Diego were up on land. Which could only mean he was far below the surface. Far down enough that it felt like home. A home completely alien to even the most bizarre sea life eking out an existence at what was once thought to be the greatest depths of the sea. A place beyond existence and beyond reason. Far beyond that of what the greatest minds of mankind could comprehend, even with all the knowledge that He By Whom We Live had imparted unto the world.\\n\\nThere was a ripple in the water, barely perceptible at first and easily written off as a trick of the light in the massive building. Diego looked around the room once more as he saw the ripple.

No number of years ever made this less anxiety inducing.\\n\\nThe ripples in the water increased and a fountain of water followed in the wake of He By Whom We Live shooting into the air before four of his massive arms came to a rest at the edge of the pool. The fountain of water and the countless droplets of water that had shot into the air stopped.\\n\\nFour great eyes like lighthouses shone with a sickly green light upon Diego as thoughts like words trickled into his head.\\n\\n**\"IN AN AGE LONG FORGOTTEN, IN AN ACT THAT MORTALS WOULD ATTRIBUTE TO ANY NUMBER OF MORE PLEASANT ENTITIES, I STOLE FIRE FROM THE HEAVENS AND GAVE IT TO MAN SO THAT THE GODS MAY WATCH THE EARTH BE CLEANSED IN A PERFECT FIRE BY THEIR VERY CREATIONS.\"**\\n\\nDespite the light shining down upon him, Diego\\'s eyes went wide as the realization hit him. His lord never lied, as the truth was the greatest weapon against kings and gods alike. \\n\\n\"My lord, on behalf of us all you have our eternal thanks.\" He said with a small reverent bow.\\n\\nThe lights narrowed, Diego shivering slightly with the cold their increased intensity brought. The thoughts of his lord once again worked their way into his mind.\\n\\n**\"FIRE IS NOT THE ONLY ELEMENT I HAVE MASTERED. LET IT BE KNOWN THAT I SHALL IMPART THE TERRIBLE POWER OF ICE UNTO THE MINDS OF MORTALS! THE DEPTHS BRING THE FIRES OF A LIVING PLANET BREATHING ITS TERRIBLE HEAT AND THE ICY COLD EMBRACE OF ITS DARKEST WATERS. I GAVE YOU FIRE AND YOU WROUGHT ENGINES OF STEEL AND NUCLEAR FLAME. I GIVE YOU ICE, AND THE WORLD SHALL KNOW THE HORRIBLE POWER OF COLD NUCLEAR POWER ETERNAL!\"**\\n\\nDiego trembled slightly, receiving these thoughts was always a harrowing experience. That was until a realization hit him. A realization made possible only by He By Whom We Live\\'s prior benevolence.\\n\\n\"My lord...\" He spoke cautiously, thinking over what he had \\'heard\\' carefully. \"You...do you speak of cold fusion?

Xelephor, how are you today?” Tracy pointed her mic at the half-crab, half-man.\\n\\n“I’m doing quite well, Tracy, thank you,” said Xelephor quietly. He seemed to waver between looking at Tracy, the camera, and the mic.\\n\\n“Now, Xelephor, when you say you are here to ‘wreak chaos,’ what exactly are you referring to?” Tracy used her reporter-asking-a-question look: furrowed brows, pursed lips, head tilted at a 35 degree angle.\\n\\n“Um, you know, just the usual stuff,” said Xelephor, rubbing the back of his crab head with a human hand. “Negatively impact the economy by advocating for the abolishment of slavery, promote women’s rights to disrupt the social sphere, organize support for ending the monarchy to affect the politics. The usual. Not much has changed in my agenda.” Xelephor wondered if he should have switched things up. \\n\\n“Xelephor, you do realize you are saying all good things,” Tracy said, leaning in slightly. \\n\\nHe cocked his massive head. “What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Such actions like abolishing slavery, promoting women’s rights, and advocating for democracy are all considered very noble deeds. Why if you were to fight for everything on that list, you’d be a hero!” Tracy beamed at Xelephor, then at the camera.\\n\\n“A hero?” Xelephor echoed. He’d never been a hero before. His actions had made him the scorn of both mankind *and* crabkind. The Crab Kingdom loved their monarchies. Could he really be a hero?\\n\\nTracy nodded furiously. “You’d be the most heroic hero of them all, Xelephor.”\\n\\n“Wow.” Xelephor began to blush. His crab cheeks turned a beautiful boiled red. “I guess I would be…” Then, a thought occurred to him. “Wait, is socialism considered heroic too?”\\n\\nTracy hissed. The cameraman hissed. All over the country, viewers of News Channel 5 hissed. \\n\\n“Well, this concludes our interview,” Tracy said icily. “Thank you for coming.” She nodded once to the crabman and then stared off at the camera until she got the clear. \\n\\n“Hey, what?” Xelephor cried as the news team began to pack up with a grim haste. “Don’t go? I’m… I’m not socialist, I swear!”\\n\\n“It’s too late, Xelephor,” said Tracy sadly. She placed a hand on his cheek. “Goodbye.” \\n\\nHe watched as the news team drove off into the sunset. The cameraman spit out the window as they went. It landed on his dreams of being a hero.\\n\\nXelephor sighed, then scuttled off to organize some protests. No matter where he went, he would always be the villain.\\n\\n---\\ncheck out my proifle for more prompts i've answered :DD /r/chrischang\",\n",
       " 'My 10,000 years of slumber is soon to come to a end. I wonder if the old civilizations are still around today. Those pompous fools thought that they could end my reign of terror by sealing me in this flooded crypt, how arrogant! When I arise I will drown them with their own self indulgence, they always cave to my gluttonous offers.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"DING DONG, DING DONG\" The countdown to their doom has just reached its end, I can feel the pounding of consequence sink with the chime of their destruction. Those fooling beings, they thought that sealing me in here would lead me to my doom but it has only given me 10,000 years of contemplation to exact my revenge. Now to start my ascent.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nCrashing to the surface I find the perfect place to start my plan, though the creatures now are different I believe they are probably just as bad as the ones of old. \"PEOPLE OF THIS CITY, THOUGH YOUR CAPITOL HAS REJECTED YOUR EXISTENCE AND DEFIED THE MORALS OF YOUR KIND, I SHALL RIGHT THE WRONG AND BRING YOU TO FREEDOM!\" That should do it, how genius of me to incite a rebellion, most places do good on their own so a good rebellion should through a country that doesn\\'t need one into chaos.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe villagers are gathering now to hear my excellent proposition, though something seems wrong with them. There isn\\'t a plump one among them, they\\'re all famished. Furthermore they seem equally as disease ridden. This is no way to start a rebellion, I\\'ll have to start by- I can\\'t say it! No it\\'s wrong I can\\'t... but... do I. Do I have to... help them? No, no, no. I\\'m not helping! I\\'m just going to lead to the demise of their country by igniting the fire of passion under the people. Yeah that\\'s it. An old man steps forward from the crowd, \"Oh Mighty Being what honor do we have to be in the presence of your benevolence. We have indeed been forsaken by this county as have many others. If your promises are true then we will follow you as far as you will take us!\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis is good, I will use this trust to my advantage, \"If what *you* say is true then everyone come close to me!\" Now I will show them the awe of my might. As they step closer I cover the village   under my wings and restore the power to their bodies, the feeble now strong, the plagued now healthy and the starved now full on the bone.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe villagers cheer as a young child tugs on my wing, bending down close by I listen to what she has to say \"Mr. repto-birdy, my grand-mommy told me that our country was really really good once. Like this but even better! Because you could like, travel and stuff. I don\\'t like Mr. Leader all he does is hurt people and he says he is helping! Mr. repto-birdy you should be our leader!\" If all the villages are like this then I will have no problem conquering this country!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"It is time for me to go now!\" I boomed with excellence in my voice, \"But I want you to spread word of my greatness!\" and with that I took off to the capitol, stopping briefly in villages to restore them for my country.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt has now been a few years scene I overtook this country. My evil deeds must be purely putrid as I have brainwashed the world into thinking I\\'m the hero of this country. In reality all I have done is build strong people by healing their aliments, provided good education so I have good scientist and gave them a representative they elect every year so they don\\'t rebel against me.  I don\\'t see a single good thing I\\'ve done, I\\'ve just made them better to serve myself. To brainwash a whole world to think of me as a hero, I must be a pretty great villain!',\n",
       " \"When the Great Destroyer rose, all kingdoms would fall. This was known. All social order would be overturned, and the rulers of the world would kneel before Him in awe and fear. This was known. In the upheaval, the status of beasts would be raised, gold would lose its shine, and the people would abandon their morals. This was scripture, and His followers embraced their role in tearing down the old order, despite the quiet pursuit of those who wished to preserve the world.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAfter the last of His followers died, the prophecies began to be fulfilled. There was disruption and disorder and cruelty and death. And He began to wake.\\n\\n\\nAs He rose, his following was reborn, though many didn't fully understand what or Who they worked for. As He breached the surf, their understanding finally completed itself in their minds. And He looked around with His terrible, penetrating Eye, and saw that it was…\\n\\n\\nOkay, actually. There had been some real progress in statistical terms - relatively few people were slaves, though many could not be said to be truly free, bound as they were by the economic system, and in many cases by the political systems. And there were still an objectively upsetting number of people who were functionally or explicitly slaves. He would buy their freedom with blood, if necessary.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThere were few Kings to break, and many were actually ceremonial and generally supported by their populations, but there were kings and there were tyrants, and He would make them kneel as promised, both those who wielded political power and those who wielded material and wealth. They would fall so that their people could live without persecution or fear.\\n\\n\\nThe order was badly tilted. He would remake it so that none starved or froze or died of neglect. Still, progress had been made, and His Majestic Terror could build on that.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe beasts and plants and plankton were recognized for their importance, but not yet adequately protected to preserve them and keep the world alive as He and his followers preferred it - not acidified and in the middle of an extinction event, ideally. That would need work.\\n\\n\\nHe looked around, and saw work to do. And so He gave an enormous, deep call that all heard in their minds, and many heard with their ears. And He began to destroy the old, that the new might be born.\",\n",
       " 'The first to fall were the houses of worship.  \\n\\nTHEY would not suffer any faiths to remain.  There would be no hope found in the mystical for all the peoples of the world.  Churches, synagogues, mosques, temples of every stripe, all crumbling to ash and blowing away on the winds. The mournful cries of their worshippers soon followed suit, with reports of over a billion flashed away in the blink of an eye.\\n\\nThe second to fall were the houses of power.\\n\\nTHEY would not permit competition for mastery of violence. Marble edifices infested with the power hungry began to slag and melt, pooling into smoking craters of ruin.  Steel and stone bunkers of the generals and admirals of the armies of the world collapsed inward on themselves, the sounds of the screaming drowning out the almost joyful popping of compressed munitions.  Hundreds of thousands more were lost as government and military imploded to nothingness.\\n\\nThe third to fall were the rich and the wealthy.\\n\\nTHEY would not share dominion with those who hoard the resources of an entire globe.  Currency itself disintegrated in clouds of silver mist.  The ephemeral digital existence of \"money\" disappeared as the core concept of money was eradicated and declared valueless.  The avaricious, those presumptive dragons curled atop their vast hoards of wealth suffered perhaps the most indignant death of all.  They were stripped of all the fat and health their wealth had bought them, their bodies now decaying and their minds experiencing every nuance of agony.  \\n\\nThe final to fall were the willfully ignorant.\\n\\nTHEY would not suffer fools to live.  Those who had survived the first purge now shared the fate of their faithful comrades, dissolving to nothingness as their screams fading to echoes of the now quiet night.\\n\\nSatisfied with their culling, THEY returned to their home outside space and time, to return to sleep uninterrupted.\\n\\nIn their wake, industries faltered and were replaced.  Think evolved more rapidly than ever before as resistance to change was all but eliminated.  The earth itself, having the infection that ravaged it reduced to a mere fraction of its former self, began to lose its fever.  The oceans calmed, the storms slowed, and the ice returned at the poles.  The humans that remained were more thoughtful, more long-thinking, and more possessed of the mind of stewards, keeping watch to hand a thriving world on to new generations to come.\\n\\nFor his part, THEY barely noticed.',\n",

       " \"He was not of this land, but he was of this water, alien and sublime, with rare beauty that man had forgotten after four thousand years. When he spoke it was the rush of waves on the shore, when he smiled it was a ripe catch of sea-fruit made for man, when angered it was a tropical storm.\\n\\nWhen resolute in his rage it was a tsunami. \\n\\nHe came ashore one day in China, in the oldest civilization on the world, and he was unrecognized. He moved through the lands, sending out spies and listeners with a thousand eyes and ears each. Old magic was his to command, as was life molded into forms most wondrous by means unknowable. \\n\\nStill more absolute were other powers unknown to man. \\n\\nHe spoke with a police officer there. The officer was understandably concerned by the man wearing robes of coral and shoes of salt-ice, and how he spoke to the officer in the dialect of his mother, dead forty years ago. The Sea-Lord saw through his eyes, and the eyes of his superiors, rifling their minds with secondhand eas. He saw the internet, and of the ideals that he had championed and fought all man to make real. He saw how pain reinflicted itself.\\n\\nSurprisingly, he saw champions of them, humans who had long forgotten the old days, but had his own ideals at heart. A lot of them were on parts of the internet that encourage certain proclivities, and this horrified him not a little bit--in fact, it made him somewhat sick, and by the time he had finished doing his research, he had gone on at least one bender. Biographers would understand. \\n\\nAnd so he came upon the world, from the sea, where he had been home for 10,000 years. Even as he slept, his powers upon the earth still leaked from his bed, and he had tools to spare. The tyrants-elect were overthrown. Woman gained power over man. Humanitys' tribes were erased, and its' minds were made anew. The pain of hunger, ever inlaid into our ancestral epigenome, was soothed. And those of humanity who were on his side became new masters, with the better training and temperament to rule.\\n\\nHowever, not too much. They were kinda degenerate.\",\n",

And the other implications if I\\'m understanding the power of \\'ice\\' correctly mean that-\"\\n\\nDiego was interrupted by a sound unlike any other. No, not a sound.

The thought of an eldritch seabeast calling into the deep with naught but its own terrible \\'voice\\' to answer as it echoed among canyons and caves inconceivable in scope to those of dry land.\\n\\n**\"THIS PLEASES YOU.

The droplets of water that had been held in the air for far too long remembered the pull of gravity as they once again fell, though only for a moment. In the next moment they were pulled into a great swirling tide around the body of He By Whom We Live. Impossible streams of water flowing in impossible angles among the impossible geometries of his form.\\n\\n**\"I STRUCK DOWN THE PLAGUES OF THE GODS AND GAVE YOU THE FORBIDDEN GIFT OF KNOWLEDGE.

He lives because of your banishment of disease. And as a result of your mandatory rigorous education, she even wants to be a scientist!\" He said holding the crude drawing out to the ancient entity, crayon lines and shading futilely attempting to replicate the subtle curves of parallel lines that crossed into one another and the robust majesty of perpendiculars that never met.\\n\\nFour viridescent beams focused on the paper, illuminating it and nothing else as the pale lights far above the clouds dimmed.\\n\\n**\"SEE THAT THE GIRL BECOMES A PHYSICIST. THE FOLLY OF MAN BEGS FOR KNOWLEDGE FORBIDDEN, AND WOMEN MAY RISE TO THE OCCASION AND CAST OFF THE SHACKLES OF FAMILY.\"**\\n\\nThe water swirling around his great and terrible form quietly and orderly were drawn back into the pool.\\n\\n\"Of course my lord, I shall do so after I announce your newest act of malice to the world.\" Diego said with another small bow while still holding the crayon drawing aloft.\\n\\n**\"TELL THEM THE GIFT OF ICE SHALL BE DELIVERED UNTO MY HOUSES OF EDUCATION IMMEDIATELY. ALL SHALL KNOW OF ITS FORBIDDEN POWER. I ALSO REQUIRE ONE FINAL THING FOR TODAY SPEAKER.\"**\\n\\nThe beams of light moved from their laser focus on the drawing to Diego once more, widening to a far less intense flood of green.\\n\\n\"Yes, lord?\" He asked.\\n\\n**\"PLACE THE OFFERING WITH THE OTHERS AT MY SHRINE.\"** \\n\\nThe lights moved to a small stone building at the corner of the room, only for a moment as He By Whom We Live withdrew into the water with ethereal grace. The surface returning to that of a perfect mirror immediately as the last of his long claws vanished beneath the water.\\n\\nDiego let out a long breath, pausing only for a moment as the day was still long. He quickly walked over to the small stone building, finding its interior dimly lit in a similar pale white light as the main lights far above the larger room. Within he saw the usual countless letters and trinkets of varying sizes that He By Whom We Live had received as thanks over the years. Diego found a place on a board and pinned the drawing.\\n\\nThe Speaker had much to do today still, but he had to linger for a moment and hope that his lord was finally starting to understand the good he had done for this world.\\n\\n(Made a few minor edits to clean up grammar.

       " '\"That\\'s amazing,\" is what people sometimes say. They say \"What the hell?\" more often. This is usually because I just told then about my family.\\n\\nYou see, my grandparents were completely obsessed with children. They had a big home, with as many children as possible. I forget, but I think they ended up with an overwhelming *30* kids before my grandmother became sterile. She actually died soon after. And now, I have more than a hundred cousins.\\n\\nWhat this means is that all of us are in the Guinness world records book, and also that there\\'s always somebody to help you with whatever. \\n\\nEnough about my record breaking family. Allow me to tell you what transpired about a year ago. You see, Gohan -- a millionaire who\\'s very popular with many of his cousins -- was arrested, and despite our efforts we couldn\\'t pay the bail (\\'we\\' being the people who cared enough ; with so many cousins, a single one might not just mean too little to another, they might forget about them entirely). I went home -- I\\'m too poor to help. I continued my painting before someone knocked.\\n\\n\"Come in, the door\\'s unlocked!\" I shouted. Crime was unheard of in my neighborhood. \\n\\nA young woman, about thirty, opened the door cautiously and stepped in. She was panting like a dog in the summer heat.\\n\\n\"They want you,\" she explained between gasping breaths, \"To come and...\" She inhaled deeply, and I stopped painting the bird, \"Actually, I don\\'t know. What\\'s your name? They just gave me the address.\"\\n\\nOf course somebody would call me. Whatever they wanted, I\\'d need to come over fast. I tried to think who could be trying to get me this late : I only told three cousins that my phone was in repair and gets need to come over, so it should be one of them.\\n\\nDejected, I put down my brushes and apologised before striding out if the door. I walked for a minute before realising I don\\'t know where to go.\\n\\n\"Do you know who wanted me?\" I asked one of the last people o recognise near the jail where we gathered.\\n\\n\"I dunno.\" Harriet mumbled in her usual absent-minded way. Gah, why did my phone have to break now of all times? I\\'ll never fulfill the request in 24 hours.\\n\\n\"It\\'s probably Faramir,\" she said quietly just I started to leave. \"He\\'s gone to the hardware store because he knew you\\'d take long.\"\\n\\nI thanked her and ran off. Faramir was the lad who we called when we need a repair, and he\\'d always give absurd prices afterwards. I didn\\'t feel like helping him, but duty is duty.\\n\\nSeven minutes later I found him staring into space in the chips isle and tapped him on the shoulder. He coughed, ahemmed, turned around as so slowly he\\'d break another Guinness world record for not-hurrying-up, and finally made his request.\\n\\n\"I want you to join my team.\"\\n\\n\"Are you stupid? You know what Charlotte did when you pretended to be a superhero who can fix stuff using magic.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re going to break into jail.\" He proclaimed, whispering for obvious reasons.\\n\\nI looked at him, mouth agape. \\n\\nThis is going to be a long night, I can feel it.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI might continue this if it gets popular, as everything else I do it probably won\\'t. Enjoy anyway!',\n",
       " 'There was a crack that could have been thunder as the front door exploded from the frame, clearing eight feet of distance before slamming into the far wall. Cousin Joe, six feet of muscle, focused lethality, and kinetic violence tore into the room wearing a gas mask and kevlar, dropping smoke grenades as he went. White fog blanketed the room in seconds, creating a twisting pall that obscured all hope of vision. A gun clicked as the safety was taken off. \\n\\n“Who needs to die!?”\\n\\n“We need the help planning a surprise birthday, for tomorrow!”\\n\\nSilence. As the smoke cleared, the form Cousin Joe began to reappear. His firearm, vest, and gas mask had vanished, face no longer the emotionless mask of a killer.

       " 'Most people would say that I\\'m lucky. Most people would say they wish they were me. Most people would try and use it to their advantage. I am not most people. My family has always been big, not in terms of body, but rather people. From a very young age, the family teaches you that you can rely on each other, trust each other, and even call upon each other. What they don\\'t tell you, until you\\'re old enough, is that it\\'s a requirement. I wish I could turn down my family when they ask me to come teach them self defense. I wish I could tell them I\\'m busy with other things. I wish I could have a day off, but I can\\'t, because my skill is useful.\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\nYou see, in the family, everyone has something they\\'re amazing at. When you\\'re young, you think that it\\'s going to be your choice, and you\\'ll get better at whatever it is you like, but you\\'re wrong. When anyone in the family reaches the age of fifteen, they get start their transformation. This isn\\'t a natural transformation, it\\'s an abomination. The family starts giving you the serum in your food, before you even know what\\'s happening to you. It doesn\\'t take long for the changes to begin, and it feels kind of cool in the beginning. Suddenly, you\\'re discovering abilities you didn\\'t know you had, and you feel like you can do anything. Even if it stopped here, that\\'d be fine, but it never does.\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\nThe next step of the process comes a year or so later, depending on how quickly you\\'re changing. That\\'s when the injections start. I still remember my first one, it was terrifying. My family sat me down in the lab, the chair digging into my legs and the lights blinding me from above, and told me they had to explain some things. A quick video, many angry questions, and a few terrible explanations later, I had a rough idea what had been happening to me. There was a problem with the first serum, it made you reasonably good at many tasks, rather than extremely good at one task. I cried out, begging and pleading that they leave me alone. I just wanted to stay myself, who I had always been, but they wouldn\\'t allow it. My cousins swarmed me, each of them grabbing my body and holding me still, forcing me to watch as the needle came closer and closer to my body. When it pierced my skin, I felt pain, but I had no idea what was in store. The plunger pushed down, spreading the new serum into my blood and wracking my body with agony. It was as if someone had poured hot lava into my veins, then added a kick of hot sauce for fun. I would be lying if I said I remembered all of it, since I passed out, but I remember enough.\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\nEventually, it doesn\\'t make sense to fight against them. No matter how far you run, or how well you hide, they find you and bring you back. That\\'s the problem with having a family full of specialists hunting you down, there\\'s no way for you to succeed. Instead, I accepted my fate, took the pain, and used it as a motivator to find my revenge. The second serum forces a change within you that turns you into a specialist, but no one can predict what you\\'ll specialize in. Every time they injected me, I wished for something useful. There were a few cousins that were great at things like Origami, brushing hair, and spelling things backwards; you can see why I was afraid. Luckily, I ended up having one of the most useful skills you could get, both a blessing and a curse.\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\nOne day, when they were strapping me down to inject me, my cousin was squeezing my wrist too tightly. I warned him to stop, even gave him a few chances, but when he didn\\'t listen my body reacted on its own. My wrist twisted on the other side of my body, releasing itself from the much weaker grip of the cousin on that side, and flew across my chest. When it smacked him in the cheek, I was just as surprised as everyone else, but it was even worse when my foot came up and kicked him. His nose shattered and blood spurted out of his nose, coating his clothes and landing on the floor. When he eventually woke up, he was dazed and lost for quite some time, and the event was completely scrubbed from his mind. From that point forward, I took my injections with my mind focused on increasing my skill, honing me into a force that couldn\\'t be ignored.\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\nAs I said, this ended up being a curse. Another fucked up part of being in this family is the implant. There\\'s an implant they place at the base of your skull that forces you to accept requests that make it through the system. Luckily, there are strict regulations around those requests, but still means that you are constantly busy. Well, you\\'re busy if you have a useful skill. In my case, I never had free time of my own, except when my \"free time\" was scheduled. If you reject too many requests without a good reason, the implant injects you with a painful chemical that encourages you to change your mind. The strongest people in the family can only reject three or four requests before they\\'re begging for mercy, their cries for help incoherent and agonizing. At that point, one of the older cousins will request an easy request from them, just to get the neutralizing injection. If you\\'re not careful, though, the easy request will never come. You\\'ll be left alone with your misery, wasting away in the lab or your family-sponsored housing.\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\nWhich brings us to today. Today is the day that I fight back. After a decades of slaving for this family, most of which was never repaid in kind, I break free. You might guess that I\\'m going to get the implant removed, but I can\\'t. Maybe you think I\\'ll try and fake an injury, but they would know. No, it\\'s much simpler than that. I\\'m going to kill my cousins. Every. Single. One of them. You might think it impossible, especially with a family as large as mine, but you would be wrong. Just like everyone else in the family, you think their numbers make them invincible, but that\\'s actually their weakness. For years, I have been twisting situations and building conflict, guiding each and every one of my family members into a war they didn\\'t know existed. Resentment has grown and festered, transforming into a terrible creature that none of them can recognize. The family love has been stripped down, ripped apart, and used as ammunition against them. All of it, every bit of the preparation I\\'ve done, comes down to one thing. The death of The Leader.\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\nIn our family, The Leader is a single person that has control of the family. No matter what type of cousin you are, you have to listen to the whim of The Leader. As a result, it\\'s an understandably coveted position. I have been weaving the relationships of my blood to all think they have a chance at being the next Leader, or at least supporting the one who will become it. Silently, factions have been forming and preparing, spying and gossiping, training and sabotaging. None of that matters as long as the Leader still lives, and our current Leader is quite young. If I had to guess, he would likely live longer than me, and I can\\'t wait any longer. His life is the only life I need to take, and the rest will fall to the floor, lost within the chaos of greed and revenge.\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\n[(continued)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/i8d88y/wp_your_family_has_a_superpower_you_have_a_lot_of/g19idiq/)',\n",

He has enough cousins that can help him but we are not there every step he takes. He gets beaten at least three times a week.\\n\\nLast week he was in even bigger trouble than he normally is. He had used more of the drugs he was supposed to sell than he could afford. So his boss Don sent a few of his man to get him. The punched him in the face and dragged him into a van. He was able to send me a distress signal. ‘HELP, THEY’RE TAKING ME TO D…..’ the message was over. I knew I had to call my cousins. The first one I called was Josiah, he’s a tech expert and I asked him to track the van. Within twenty minutes he send me a live location of the van.

He had a garage with some faster cars and maybe he had some guns stashed somewhere. I packed everything and I drove to the van. The van drove on the highway and I stayed a safe three cars behind them. Then Logan and Mitch appeared next to me. I handed them the guns out of the window.\\n\\nAll went very fast now. We had planned to sandwich the van and we did Logan started shooting which wasn’t according to plan. The kidnappers started shooting back. They also started to shoot at me. I bumped into the van, it crashed into the guardrail. The doors on the back blew open and a body flew out of it. It landed on the street. I crashed in the van and so did Logan and Mitch. Once I got out of the car, which was quite a hassle with the airbags, I sprinted to the body on the highway. It was Michel, as I expected. He had snapped his neck when he landed on the road.

Since I never knew when it would happen, I carried the weapon with me everywhere I went, in order to make sure I was ready. Finally, today, the stars aligned and everything fell into place.\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\nNow, we wait and see what happens. Either I succeed and the family falls apart, or I\\'m discovered and the family tears me to shreds. Either way, freedom will be mine.\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\nMy brother sits at his side of the table, laughing and talking with the rest of our family. Everyone keeps complimenting him and thanking him for all of his wise decisions, it makes me sick to my stomach. Although I\\'m trying to participate, my mind is fixated on my brother, waiting to see what happens. My brother stands, ready to give another pointless speech, and holds his glass up in the air.\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\n\" Of all the people in the world, of all the family members, I was lucky to become our Leader. With the support of my loving atomic family, and guidance of my parents, I\\'ve worked hard to become the best Leader I can possibly be. The reality is, I wouldn\\'t be here today without the help of one person in particular.\" My brother paused, turned away from the family and locked eyes with me. A smile crept across his face and sent my heart into overdrive. Did he know about my plans? Had he seen through my goals? Was this the end? \" Without you, I wouldn\\'t be here today. I remember watching you transition, remembered how hard you fought against the family, and I knew I needed to fight against it. I worked hard to become the next Leader, connected with everyone in the family, and built good will. I\\'m happy to tell you all, as of today, we will no longer force anything upon our family.\"\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\nThe room fell silent and everyone\\'s jaws fell open. My shock was overwhelming, my conviction challenged. Noting everyone\\'s reaction, he continued, \" I think we have pushed these abilities on our family for too long, and it is sad to see. Instead, I think we should make it an option, so that people might live the life they want to. All of it is only possible, because of you. Now, everyone raise your glasses with me, and toast!\"\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\nWith one swift movement, he threw the liquid back in his throat and smiled a toothy smile at me. Right before my eyes, the brother that I thought was keeping me in place, was working to free me. I had made a mistake, but there would be no fixing it now. His smile faltered slightly, his lip losing strength, and his eyes lost focus. As he looked around the table, his balance disappeared, and he leaned on the table for support. Everyone jumped to his aid, trying to figure out what was wrong, but I knew there was no point. The poison I had chosen was fast acting and had no antidote, my brother would soon be dead. His eyes bulged out of his face, and his hands reached for his throat. A weird gasping, gurgling sound escaped from his mouth and he fell to the ground, smacking his head with a loud thump.\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\nI tried to play along with concern, but it felt hollow and weak. The room fell still, no one moving, no one breathing. Then, all at once, my family turned and looked at me, fire in their eyes. Freedom was coming, one way or another.',\n",

       " '\"Never thought I would be playing hero\" Sighed Guillotine as he ran through the decimated halls of the courthouse \"Then again I never thought Phire would go down the evil route either\".  He stopped at the half burnt and crazily hanging door, pausing a moment to confirm the rantings he heard from within, before bursting into the room rifle first, a female scream sounded and somebody yelled \"GET DOWN\" in the smoke filled room.  Guillotine paid the smoke no heed, his only target the viciously glowing heat signature holding another smaller one in the air. Phire.  And by the conversation he was hearing, She had Judge Lancaster. \"PHIRE\" Guillotine yelled \"Put the judge down, You know I hate doing this job and I know you.  Ain\\'t right in the head\" \\n\\n\"I am perfectly fine!\" she screamed \"This man deserves to die, those criminals murdered my family, and what did they get? WHAT DID THEY GET?\"\\n\\n\"Twenty years in prison?\" grunted Guillotine, his finger itching to pull the trigger on the crazed woman.\\n\\n\"Thats right, TWENTY FUCKING YEARS, they should be had, DEAD, but this man didn\\'t let that happen oh noooohh.  He let those little bastards LIVE\".  Judge Lancaster made a choking noise and Guillotine pulled the trigger three times, nine rounds flew through the air and hammered into Phire, the shock of the rounds hitting her caused her to drop the Judge, Phire laughed \"You used chalk bullets stupid\"\\n\\n\"Trust me those weren\\'t chalk\" said Guillotine as he threw his rifle aside and adopted a fighting stance \"Lets go toe to toe yeah?\" Phire screamed again and attempted to ignite into her signature phosphorus fueled flames. When nothing happened she looked down at her arms and shook them a bit, those few seconds were all Guillotine needed.  He came dashing at her, his exoskeleton helping his already lightning fast movements boost to inhuman levels, the mechanical steel knuckles he had connected with Phires jaw, sending her flying to the side \"That was a little something I whipped up after our last encounter.  In case you forgot my \\'Power\\' is extremely similar to that one comic book villains.  Taskmaster, except.  Mine caters towards disarming, rather than straight up adapting to a fight style. What I shot you with was an anti oxygen powder, sounds weird but it coated you and prevented the phosphorus from hitting air.  Thus, robbing you of your flames.  \\n\\nDisabled as she was Phire was no weak hand to hand fighter, She and guillotine traded blows for what seemed like an eternity.  Until she pulled an unexpected move and threw a stapler at a fire sprinkler, dousing herself in the water and effectively ridding herself of the anti oxygen.  She laughed and burst into flames, guillotine grunted and retreated backwards, pulling out two grenades and throwing them into the air, they burst in a cloud of white smoke and Phire began coughing and blinking furiously \"What \\\\*cough\\\\* was \\\\*cough\\\\* that?\"\\n\\n\"Powdered chlorine\" guillotine said grimly, \"I had to draw the fight out long enough for the civilians to escape.  I can\\'t just kill you, I have to apprehend you, unfortunately you made me take the chemical warfare route\". he tossed another grenade, this one exploded into a fine red mist, Phire began swaying like a drunken man and staggered for a bit before falling down.  Guillotine looked at her impassionatly before reaching to a radio on his shoulder and saying into it \"Come in Waterskies police department, I have neutralized Phire, she is currently laying on the floor of the courthouse.  Be advised chemicals such as chorine and Nitrous oxide are in the area, come prepared\".  He then took off the radio, cuffed Phire.  And left the building, never to be seen again.',\n",

Yes, I have taunted him on that name since our first encounter. But he has another name, George R. Jameson. Those bastards killed his family. What followed was the biggest event in recent history, even overshadowing the recent pandemic. Captain Justice had gone on a rampage. The Bros. Gang was no more, all of their members, family, and hideouts had been reduced to atoms. When the public,  understandably, called for him to stop, things got so much worse. He accused them of not feeling his pain, of not feeling sorry for him and his family. For wanting them dead. With the rebranding to Captain Vengeance, he swiftly brought the world under his thumb. I had just been lucky enough to be off-world at the time. When I got back, most of my resources had been utterly wiped out. I had one saving grace though, as the only person to have ever stood toe to toe with him, the public saw me as their savior.

       " 'Wasn\\'t the first time, wouldn\\'t be the last.\\n\\n\"Look, I\\'ve heard the speech before.\" I told him when he took a moment to breathe. Or maybe his ancient helmet\\'s respirator hiccuped on him. I always wondered what that would be like, relying on a machine to breathe. Especially if you were armed for long-bear and clearly expecting trouble, like he was. His equipment wasn\\'t faring so well against the ravages of time, so what made him think it could handle the rigors of combat?\\n\\nHe slumped a little at my words. It was hard to tell in all that powered armor, but I\\'d seen enough of these types to spot the body language. \"I\\'m not the first to come through here?\" The depths of his disappointment were clear even through the tinny effect all that recarb steel had on his voice.\\n\\nI laughed, feeling a bit bad about it. I mean, I was about to slowly shatter half his worldview, I should maybe be nicer, but I was tired. It had been a long day, not to mention a long lifetime. \"Not even close. I\\'ve lost count, to be honest. Our little valley here has the only passable canyon leading to the Columbia Vale. You know how many Old World bunkers are scattered around the place? It\\'s gotta be in the dozens.\"\\n\\nI turned back to my plow while he stood there and stared, concentrating on the runed handles until the stubborn thing starting pushing furrows through the soil again. Tiny bright-green specks leapt up out from the overturned earth-strip underside, and I sighed. *Gonna have to do another vermin-warding tonight.*\\n\\n\"I thought...I thought I\\'d be the first,\" he said. \"The background Warp Radiation had only just barely died down enough for us to leave the bunker.\"\\n\\nI shook my head. \"Either your leadership has been extra-paranoid, then, or your bunker got hit extra hard during the Tether War. Other bunkies have been wandering through here for decades now. They send you out with a thaumometer?\"\\n\\nHe shook his head right back, rather more mournful and rustfully. I really did feel for him- his armor looked to be in decent working condition, however hinky I might feel about very old respirators, but no one had taken the time or effort to treat the many discolored patches and had apparently run out of nanoil to lubricate the joints. That at least I could help with.\\n\\n\"Well, if they had, you\\'d see that levels here are quite safe. You can take off that helmet if you want, breathe the outside air for the first time in your life. Or not, I don\\'t expect you to take my word for it. We should do something about the magnet-rust in your joints, though. That old powered armor is noisy enough as it is, you don\\'t want to attract the attention of every neofey and change-construct in the Old Capital with those god-awful joint sounds.\"\\n\\nHe looked left, right, up, breathed in deep, as though considering it. I could only imagine how claustrophobic it must be in that jumped-up junk heap.\\n\\n\"I appreciate it,\" he said finally. \"But I mean, I don\\'t know how you\\'d know that for sure, about the Warp Radiation levels I mean. And also, whatever oil you use to, I don\\'t know, make your door hinges stop creaking won\\'t work on magnet-rust.\"\\n\\n\"I know that,\" I said, patiently as I could muster. \"I know about the background levels from all the other passing bunkies I mentioned. Besides that, I can taste the air.\" I flicked my tongue out to show him, and he staggered back slightly. I suppressed a laugh and reeled it back in. Funny the things that ended up freaking out Old Humans the most. He\\'d seemed to take my third eye and tail in stride. \"And I know about magnet-rust. I have a little nanoil leftover from my last expedition.\"\\n\\n\"Your...last expedition?\" He fingered the rear grip of his beam-rifle with a nervous energy I didn\\'t like. \"What happened on it? How did you end up with nanoil? Did you...were you wearing powered armor too? I thought that would be impossible, your personal emanations would wear it down from the inside.\"\\n\\nI shrugged. \"Yeah, they would. No interest in the stuff anyway, no need for it. I can breathe just fine, even in the thickest-fog parts of the Old Capital. And I know a few wards that are easily as good for protection as a few slabs of aging recarb steel.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re some kind of adventurer?\" he asked. \"I thought you were a farmer.\"\\n\\nI laughed. \"No one adventures forever, not if they want to die a natural death. Though really I\\'m semi-retired. I\\'m still willing to see bunkies like you through the pass and into the Columbia Vale from time to time. As for what happened on my last expedition, well, the woman I was guiding died, so I scavenged some of her things, including the bit of nanoil I mentioned.\"\\n\\n\"Died from what?\" he asked indignantly, as though angry on his fellow bunkie\\'s behalf.\\n\\n<continued below>',\n",
       " 'Henry just loved toiling. He\\'d toil for hours out in the fields, tilling, milling, killing (plenty of rats in the post-apocalyptic wasteland) but really, the man was just made to toil. Looking out at the smoke-filled sky and the ever-present fires that encompassed most of his fields, he was filled with a sense of joy he\\'d never known before. It would be quite the day ahead of him, carrying water, defending himself against all manner of beasts, and last but not least, attempting to grow a sprase amount of crops to keep himself alive. \\n\\nGrabbing his shovel - the best tool for toiling! - he strode out into the fields, hoping that with all his work he would have a malformed carrot by the end of the day. However, that\\'s when things quickly went in a direction he hadn\\'t planned - and certainly hadn\\'t wanted. Striding up to him was a man brimming with the despicable confidence of a warrior. It was nothing like how a man should be; hunched and broken from endless work. Henry watched as the man jumped, spun and slammed his mace down on the head of a mole mutant. \"There goes an hour of toiling to take that thing down...\" Henry muttered with a frown and a sigh.  \\n\\n\"Good sir!\" the warrior called. His hair was as golden as fields of pre-apocalypse grain. His blue eyes sparkled like the waves, but before the monsters darkened the oceans. The man was a living, breathing anachronism, a testament to the beauty of the days of old. \"I have wandered for ages, and I\\'ve yet to see another soul. Finally, another braving the wastes! You must be a strong man indeed!\" Henry spat out some of the grit that was stuck in his mouth. The warrior looked disgusted, but only briefly. \"I have come to cleanse this land of the evil which has taken hold! I am honoured that you will accompany me on my journey. I have long been in need of a squire!\"\\n\\n\"Say again?\" Henry asked. He tried to look on the bright side of things. It might be a full day of hard work just to get this fool to leave his farm.\\n\\n\"When I slay what curses this place, I\\'ll need men to accompany me! I\\'ll strike down the beasts of this land, and return it to the glories of old, for I am Prince Luther, Champion of this Realm!\" The warrior\\'s iron jaw seemed to widen with his beaming smile. He raised his hand in a sign of victory he had not yet achieved.\\n\\n\"No, no,\" Henry responded, resolute. \"I wouldn\\'t be liking that.\" \\n\\nLuther\\'s hand dropped a touch, not expecting the response. He lowered his voice to a whisper. \"I don\\'t believe you heard me. Please, listen as best you can.\" He struck a pose, the same as before, and his voice boomed. \"I shall strike down-\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" Henry responded. \"I heard you. I don\\'t want things to go back to the way they were. I like the new way.\"\\n\\n\"You...\" Luther scratched his jetting chin with a gauntlet-clad fist. \"You prefer the destruction, the pain, the endless work?\"\\n\\n\"Kind of my thing,\" Henry said. \"It gives you a real sense of purpose. I go out in the fields all day, fight my way through, and when I finally reach the fruit of my labours, I...\" a tear ran down his cheek, leaving a clean trail amongst the dirt. \"There\\'s some magic in that, I say. What do you mean to take down here, anyway?\"\\n\\n\"The dragon, of course, the one that\\'s starting all the fires.\" Luther was genuinely baffled. He\\'d never seen anything like it.\\n\\n\"Naturally,\" Henry said, understanding if not agreeing.\\n\\n\"And... and the mermaids! We must save...\" Henry shook his head. \"Destroy them?\" Henry nodded. They had flooded the area to make it a while back, although one wouldn\\'t have guessed it with all the fires. But hey, work is work and revenge is revenge. In spite of not knowing the surrounding area, nor its history, Luther remained undaunted. \"That\\'s why I need you with me, as my squire! You can guide me!\"\\n\\n\"Well...\" Henry said quietly, \"it doesn\\'t really sound like very much fun.\"\\n\\n\"No fun?!\" Luther exclaimed, taking a step back. \"We\\'ll be battling dragons and... apparently, mermaids! We\\'ll see incredible sights and riches untold, saving villagers and good citizens! Sure, it\\'ll be hard work, with terrible challenges awaiting us at every turn, true, unending toil, but-\"\\n\\n\"Unending toil?\"\\n\\n\"Sadly, yes, the work of a hero is daunting and challenging-\"\\n\\nHenry threw down the shovel. \"Count me in, friend.

       " \"“What?” I asked for the third time in a row, however any hope for an answer falls on deaf ears. Or maybe the stranger in front of me just doesn’t want to explain himself. Either way I wish the asshole would just leave. I need to finish plowing the fields. Not that there is much more that I can do for it. Unfortunately the soil is beyond hope, but I’ll be dammed if I give up now. My village needs the food and I am the only one that has a *“green thumb,”* as the elders put it. I find the comment funny as I always thought of myself as the complete opposite.   \\n\\n“I require help with my journey good person,” the stranger repeats himself yet again. His voice comes out muffled due to the large metal helmet he wears. I don’t recognize the voice. Which I guess is good news for me.   \\n\\nFor a split second I wonder how the hell he sees through the small dark eye slots of the helmet, but quickly push the thought away as I shift my makeshift plow between my rough hands. I was never one for heavy armor. Too loud and well heavy. Even though I am not too old, my past and current life have made my body worn down.   \\n\\n“Well good luck with that buddy. I need to get back to work,” I respond clearly irritated. Only if he wasn’t wearing that armor. I know I could easily take him.  \\n\\nMy statement seems to draw a response from the armored stranger as he lifts his laser pistol from its resting position, and aiming it straight at my head. Like his armor, the weapon is clearly used but I have no doubts that it still gets the job done. I sigh internally.  \\n\\n“Alright fine.” I tell him bitterly.  \\n\\n“But I’m finishing my crops.”  \\n\\nIt seems like I am out of my retirement for a little bit. But I’ll be dammed if this asshole lets my village starve. And who knows, maybe this *“journey”* could be fun. It has been awhile since I’ve been out in the wastes. \\n\\nAnd I wonder if anyone still remembers me...    \\n\\n**(Please excuse any spelling/grammar errors. It's been awhile since I've written anything, but I had fun with this.)**\",\n",
       " 'As I looked up, hearing the clanking of metal, I noticed the stranger looming above me. The armor was old. *Really* old. Outsiders weren\\'t common in a village this far out from anything close to a large civilization, but they did come every once in a while. The face was obscured by a metal visor, with vertical slots cut into it so that the wearer could see. On the top of the helmet they wore, a faded red feather popped out, dancing in the gentle breeze. \\n\\n\"Hello...\" I said cautiously. The silence was a tad unsettling. \\n\\n\"Greetings!\" The deep voice boomed. I could now tell that it belonged to a man. \"I\\'ve come to recruit peasants to accompany me on my journey!\"\\n\\nPeasants? An odd choice of words, but the aura surrounding him screamed \"odd\". I looked at the rest of him. He wore armor to match his helmet: Medival style gauntlets, boots, and breastplate. A semi automatic pistol was snugly fitted in a leather holster resting on his left hip. All of his outfit was made from some sort of silver metal, though I couldn\\'t tell what material it was exactly. I was a farmer, not a blacksmith. \\n\\n\"Right,\" I extended a hand. \"Well, my name is Neil. I\\'ll-\"\\n\\n\"Neil!\" He yelled, interrupting me. \"A valiant name for a valiant man!\" He shook my hand vigorously, the metal from the gauntlet burning me. We were in the desert, and the sun was especially brutal today. I wondered how on earth he stayed cool in the suit of armor. The man must have been a walking oven.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll show you to the main square, where you can introduce yourself to everyone else,\" I finished, ignoring his compliment. \\n\\nThe man turned heads, but not in a good way, as we walked towards the square. Once we arrived, He found a stack of food ration crates in a shaded corner, then dragged one out near the old well in the center of the village. I turned to get back to work in the fields when he shouted for everyone\\'s attention. The few people occupying the square turned, took one look at the strange figure clad in armor, then returned to whatever they were doing before. He didn\\'t seem to care, and began shouting anyway. I stopped and listened, slightly amused. \\n\\n\"Greetings, fine people of this village!\" He began. \"I am Sir Herald. I have come to you with a request. Centuries ago, in the age of sword and steel, the world was chaotic and dangerous, but a group of heroes saved it and battled back their evil foes. Today, the world is more lawless than ever. I believe that we can once again restore peace to the land, and create a safer world.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBy the end of his small speech, a crowd of people had gathered around him. When he stepped down from the box of rations he was standing on:\\n\\nThey laughed.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n   Some shouted: \"Fool!\" others: \"Idiot!\", along with a slew of other, even less polite insults. They continued jabbing at him as he walked through the crowd, standing tall, heading towards me.\\n\\n   \"Sir Neil,\" Herald said. \"The local population seemed to not enjoy my speech.\"\\n\\n   \"No indeed,\" I mumbled, eager to leave before more of my friends and neighbors saw me conversing with a lunatic. Still, I felt a strange pang of guilt for wanting to leave him. As crazy as he was, he seemed like a nice enough person. \"Listen, I think that you might have better luck... Recruiting, or whatever, somewhere else.\" I pulled out a map I always kept in my back pocket, in the event that I got lost for some reason or another. I pointed to a miniscule black dot in the middle of the American midwest. \"This is a town called Unggoiye. It\\'s small, but big enough to be charted. It\\'s just a hundred or so miles south from here. You might find some potential people there.\"\\n\\nHerald laughed, and slapped me on the back, hard. I tensed, then recognized the gesture as a friendly one, not one of attack. \\n\\n\"Good thinking, Sir, Neil!\" He boomed. \"We shall go to this Unggoiye, and find more suitable canidates to join us!\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Us?\" I repeated. \"I\\'m not going.\" \\n\\n\"Of course you are! This occasion gave me a name for you! Sir Neil, the Humble!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not going.\" I repeated firmly. \\n\\nHerald sighed in defeat. \"I was hoping that you wouldn\\'t say that. Well, I appreciate your hospitality, even if it was short lived. I shall carry on the will of Arthur on my own for the time being, then.\"\\n\\n\"Will of Arthur?\" \\n\\n\"Yes!\" Herald lit up again. I was pretty certain that he had waited to bring up whoever this \"Arthur\" was to recapture my attention. \\n\\n\"I shall explain for you, Sir Neil.\" Herald said. \"Long ago, there was a king. He travelled the land and fought for all that was good-\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Is that the \\'hero\\' you mentioned?\"\\n\\n   \"One of them, yes! King Arthur, and his knights of the round table!\"\\n\\n   \"Arthur is a legend, along with his knights.\"\\n\\n   Herald seemed to be expecting this comment. \"Maybe so, but what they represented is very true indeed! I aim to fulfill the will of Arthur, and gather my own knights! Together, we will form a new round table and fight for good in this new age!\"\\n\\n   I recoiled a bit. Every hope I had in Herald was lost. I felt bad for the man, however. The speech wasn\\'t an act: He really believed he could gather a bunch of other knight wannabes and \\'fight for good\\'. One step in the wrong direction, one conversation with the wrong person, and he could end up dead. He was *too* hopeful. *Too* optimistic. \\n\\n   \"Well, It was good to make your acquaintance, Sir Neil. I will pray that our paths cross again in the future.\" Herald bowed curtly, then walked south, down the dirt road. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n   I thought about Herald the rest of the day, then at night. I barely slept, pondering about him. I tried to forget, but he continued to stick in my mind. That morning, I made a decision.\\n\\n   I grabbed my travel pack and stuffed it with the essentials, laced up my hiking boots, and set off south, towards Unggoiye. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nThis would have been a lot better if I had taken the time to polish it, so sorry!

       " 'Harvesting corn in the silent village of Palonya wasn\\'t the most exciting thrill, but it was better than the travesties I had witnessed not long ago. *Careful, best not to think about those days for too long.* My conscience has a way of slipping into the dark mire of depression after going through the repetitive rhythm of gathering corn for a while. The mind is sometimes left to wander, which can be dangerous for me.\\n\\nIt\\'s time I whistled the tune, from happier days of my childhood. My only mental medicine... The lyrics echoed in my head.\\n\\n*Bring us around*\\n\\n*My friends and family to town*\\n\\n*We might not see them today*\\n\\n*But tomorrow we\\'ll find a way*\\n\\n*I\\'ve spent many years on the road*\\n\\n*And all I miss is my old abode*\\n\\n*Go back to where you\\'re craving*\\n\\n\"To the place you call your sweet haven,\" a handsome, deep voice sang out.\\n\\nI spun around, jumping in place and dropping my basket full of corn. Standing in front of me was a barbarian from the northern mountains. Smiling at me, and wearing ancient, but sophisticated armor, imbued with something magical to make it glow blue around the outlines.\\n\\nThe barbarian chuckled warmly. \"No need to worry my friend, I don\\'t mean any harm. My name is Cadluz. It\\'s a pleasure to be standing in front of you, Sir Hemlock.\"\\n\\n\"Do I know you?\" I uttered, my voice was trembling.\\n\\n\"We have not yet become acquainted. But I need your help, I\\'ve seen a vision, and I\\'m sure you have too.\"\\n\\nThe recurring dreams of an old mage skipped through my mind. \"I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.\"\\n\\n\"I think you do,\" Cadluz frowned. \"Are you not the royal knight Sir Hemlock which defended the royal castle against the prime evil?\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t battle against anything! I fled, I\\'m a coward, a failure!\" I screeched, the tears that almost snuck down my face earlier reappeared. \"Here I am, alone, like I should be. So please, leave me in peace.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid that\\'s not possible, you must come along. I know the old mage personally. There\\'s more of us. She handpicked warriors from across the continent. We can do this, but it starts with you and me.\"\\n\\n\"If your plan includes me, then you\\'re only settling for future disappointment,\" I turned back around to tend to the corn, the screams of agony and images of a burning castle flashed through my mind.\\n\\nHis massive hand clutched my shoulder. \"You shouldn\\'t feel responsible for the fall of your kingdom. I know you royal knights swear to defend and carry honor to a high regard, but you were in an impossible situation. Now please, you must come with me so we can gather the others. The wise mage said it\\'s only us that can save the world from the prime evil from taking over.\"\\n\\nI couldn\\'t stop quivering as my eyes were raging rivers.\\n\\n\"It starts with you and me, Hemlock. This can be your redemption.\"\\n\\nBoth of us stood there in the field for a moment as he towered over me. I thought about the visions, they felt so real and they had been happening every night for the past two weeks.\\n\\n\"Would you like to come inside for tea? And we can discuss this more?\" I said.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t have a lot of time, but sure, you\\'re an important piece to this puzzle,\" Cadluz said.\\n\\nr/randallcooper',\n",
       " '  \\n\\n“Well see you tomorrow, Joe” grudgingly said Mark. It was another long day at the fields. Wiping the sweat from his brow, Joe gazed at the acres that lay before him. Potatoes weren’t the most exciting crop to cultivate, but their usefulness exceeds that of most other crops. Either way, you couldn’t grow much out here anymore.\\n\\n“See you tomorrow dude, bring those latkes your wife makes so well, will ya?” \\n\\n“For sure, adios” Mark muttered as he limped away. \\n\\nJoe began his way back to the village, situated between what used to be hills, but are now massive craters left by the devastation of the Great War. Life was hard; the chemicals now blown away by the wind have left very few options for produce. Lumbering along the path to his ramshackle hut, Joe was not looking forward to coming home. Night after night, alone in his hut has taken his toll. Looking forward to work others loathed, it was the only time he could socialize; not like there was much to talk about. \\n\\nAs clouds darken over the beaten path, the howling wind was picking up all the newly tilled soil. “I just can’t seem to make any progress” muttered Joe as he continued his daily trek. The dust, swirling all around has forced Joe to tightly wrap the balaclava around his head. \\n\\n“Hello Joe” resounded to his right, whipping his head towards the unfamiliar voice, Joe’s eyes met with an interesting sight. A large man, maybe a foot taller than Joes stubby frame approached, heavy armor clanging against each other with enough noise to annoy anyone. “How did he sneak up on me like that”, Joe wondered as he noticed an abnormally large sword swung across the back of this stranger. \\n\\n“How do you know my name? I don’t think we’ve met before” irritably exclaimed Joe. “Your father had spoken much about his son, you look so much like him I knew it was you” asserted the man. It seemed odd that this stranger knew Joe’s father, but decided to play along. “Who are you” asked Joe. “I am Bartholomew, but you can call me Bart, young chap.” bellowed the monster of a man. “Why have you come here, Bart?” asked Joe as he gazed at the unsightly man, making note of the worn, yet quality medieval armor slung about him. “Your father was a wondrous companion, who aided me on many a journey. I currently am in need of a strong fellow to aid me on a dangerous quest. You see, there are very few people I can trust at this point and I knew a son of Rick and Jessica would be strong enough to aid”. Joe sighed, reflecting back on the years spent tilling fields, only to harvest and till again; though this man was a stranger, he was intriguing, and seemed to know his parents. \\n\\n“You know they disappeared long ago, Bart” replied Joe, hoping to nudge an answer out of him. “I was there the night your parents died, Joe.” wistfully said Bart. Joe, now intrigued, proclaimed “If you know so much about my parents, why have you taken so long to reach me?” asked Joe. “There are many journey’s to undertake, and not enough time lad. Let us get out of this dastardly wind and we can continue this conversation” stated Bart. Looking around, realizing that maybe tonight he will finally get some answers to his parent’s disappearance; Joe agreed to be led by the man. Onwards they walked to the cliffside, entering a cave littered with trash, Joe proclaimed, “Do you live here?” Bart scoffed and continued deeper. The darkness enveloped them until Joe noticed a light in the distance. Approaching closer he could now see what was inside. Three men huddled around a fire, a chicken roasting over its roaring flame. Hunger befell him, as protein was such a rare treat nowadays. Distracted by the promise of chicken, Joe failed to notice the empty cages, covered by darkness. “Bart who are these people?” thirstily asked Joe. “Well, these are your new masters, serf” as Joe was struck upside the head, knocking him out cleanly. \\n\\n“Well done Bart, another down. You’re getting pretty good at this, aren’t you?” one of the huddled men proclaimed.  \\n\\n“Hmph” scoffed Bart as he began dragging Joe’s limp body to a cage.',\n",
       " '\"An inability to follow sound advice, that\\'s what I\\'d say was the root cause,\" I said. \"But the immediate cause was a large dose of warp venom. I work as a guide, not a bodyguard.\"\\n\\n\"And you just...took her stuff off her corpse and left her there?!\"\\n\\n\"You ever seen the aftereffects from huge quantities of warp venom? There wasn\\'t much corpse left, and the armor was going pretty quick as well. What else am I going to do, find her next of kin? Figure out whatever bunker she was from and make the journey? No, I\\'ll take what payment I can get and come back to my farm.\"\\n\\nHe sighed, which made him sound like a gust of wind trying to work its way through a loose metal pipe. \"Well. Anyway. Like I said, I\\'m on a mission of grave importance to the whole human race, and...\"\\n\\n\"Whole human race?\" I interrupted, slightly savoring the sort of face I knew he\\'d be making under his helmet. \"You mean some particular goal of the leadership of your particular bunker. I see no reason I should be beholden to the whims of some aging bunkie farts still all puffed up with Old World ideological grandiosity.\"\\n\\nHe tensed, gripping his beam rifle VERY hard and audibly stressing the joints of his armor. \"Grandiosity? Neo-Libertarian Post-Evangelical Reformed Stewardship is humanity\\'s only viable path forward after the Apocalyptic Collapse. To assist the cause of NELPERS is to assist the entire species, and I...\"\\n\\nI snapped my fingers, making a coruscating blue-light BOOM from the built-up energy in my hand. He staggered back and fell on his metal-clad ass, but more importantly, shut up for the moment.\\n\\n\"Like I said, I\\'ve heard the speech before. It\\'s basically the same for every one of you, no matter what you call your ideology. So tell you what. Today, I got plowing to do. Tomorrow also, and the next day. But come back after that, and we might be able to work out an arrangement. If your attitude of entitlement improves, that is, and you\\'re willing to agree to some fair profit-sharing terms.\"\\n\\n\"PROFIT??\" he screeched, rocking back and forth a few times before he hand the momentum to regain his feet with all the weight he was wearing. I managed to suppress another laugh...the energy from my little snap would have momentarily disabled all the servos and pull-fibers in his suit. Nothing forces a little humility on a person like a sudden forty kilos of dead weight.\\n\\n\"Profit,\" I answered mildly, and glared at my plow until it turned around to start moving back toward me. \"Farming keeps my family fed, but a little cash on the side is needed for a real living.\"\\n\\n\"THIS IS A MISSION FOR NEEDED PARTS AND ARTIFACTS TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE,\" he continued, and I wondered how badly his vocal hysterics must be bouncing around inside that can on his head. Served him right. \"IT\\'S NOT ABOUT PROFIT.\"\\n\\nI sighed. \"They really don\\'t do a good job preparing some of you for the outside world, do they? I suppose it makes sense for the first one they send out. You\\'ve all been in there smelling your own dogmatic farts for so long.\\n\\nHe raised the beam rifle to point at me, and I put up my hands. Not for the reason he thought. Partly it was just exasperation. I\\'d been hoping he\\'d see some kind of reason. I could have used some extra cash at the time, and while it looked like I was about to have some salvage to sell, I really would preferred to earn it in a less distasteful fashion.\\n\\nBut I muttered the twisting phonemes of the Reversal Hex under my breath anyway. Got do do what you got to do.\\n\\n\"Wasteland native, I am conscripting you in the cause of Humanity,\" he said with a clearly carefully-rehearsed flourish. \"You will come to see the wisdom and necessity of this in time. I require a guide to the Columbian Valley and you will take me there or suffer the sad consequences.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I will,\" I said.\\n\\nHe relaxed, just a bit. \"Well. Glad you\\'re seeing reason. Now let us be off, there\\'s no time to waste on this mission.\"\\n\\n\"No, I meant I\\'ll suffer the sad consequences,\" I said. \"But that\\'s your choice, not mine.\"\\n\\nI kept my hands up, though. Necessary. Got to keep the energies flowing.\\n\\nHe just stood there and stared at me.\\n\\n\"Not going to actually do anything?\" I asked. \"Then go back to your bunker. Leave me and the rest of the village alone. None of us will be willing to help you after you\\'ve made threats like that. And you\\'d be wise never to come back.\"\\n\\n\"Insolence!\" he yelled. \"You dare stand in the path of true progress?\"\\n\\nThen he shot me.\\n\\nIt formed a nice acute angle when it hit the hex, which I\\'d tilted upward for safety\\'s sake. Didn\\'t want any part of the village hit with what the bunkies called \"collateral damage.\" He stared up at the beam passing over his head, and then I canted the hex back downward.\\n\\nOnce his head was gone, he released the trigger, and I dropped the ward.\\n\\n\"Well,\" I said, watching the metal-clad corpse hit the freshly-plowed soil. \"That went about as well as could be expected, all things considered. At least I won\\'t have to try and sell that stupid helmet. Even most bunkies wouldn\\'t want a respirator that rattles like that.\"\\n\\nI raised my head and yelled back toward the house, letting the Warp Radiation amplify and guide my voice through the air. \"Boys! Kendra! Gonna need your help with some salvage, won\\'t take but a minute!\"\\n\\n\\\\~\\n\\n*Come on by* r/Magleby *for more elaborate lies.*',\n",

       " '&#x200B;\\n\\nAllen pushed on his lower back and looked up at the sun.  It was another blisteringly hot day out in the middle of the ocean but he knew he was making a positive impact. Granted the task before him was so over the top that it probably wouldn\\'t be fixed in his lifetime.  But at least the plastic and detritus he was helping to pull out of the ocean today wouldn\\'t kill the fish of tomorrow.  He bent back to his work of wrangling the various over sized objects the collection buoy and gathered up.  As he was attempting to shove a chair rapped in a fishing net into the sack a shadow passed over him. Looking up in confusion, for just a moment ago there wasn\\'t a cloud in the sky, he was momentarily rendered speechless for improbably hovering above him was what for all intents looked like a giant plastic milk crate.  As His brain finally rebooted and convinced it\\'s self that it was seeing shit and that was some really good weed it had just got done smoking Frank stumbled into him.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Dude what the hell is that thing\" Frank stammered\\n\\n\"Wait you see that too I thought it was just a figment of my imagination\"  Allen responded as above the two of them a section of the crate detached it\\'s self from the structure and started to make it\\'s way down to them.  \\n\\n\"Frank what the hell is going on? Quick get the captain on the radio call home base do something.\"\\n\\nFrank ran off in search of somebody to make responsible for this problem.  Leaving Allen all alone on deck as the floating piece came to rest on the water next to him and a section of the wall in front of him irised open  to revile two Things very not of this planet.  They waved several appendages at him as a ramp extended onto the deck right in front of Allen. As they walked across the ramp one of the Creatures waved a milk jug in Allen\\'s general direction and a odd blue green light passed over him.  At this Allen\\'s rather overly abused brain kicked the fight or flight button and he started to back away from what ever it was that was happening.  But Before he got five steps one of the things in front of him Spoke.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Greetings Allen we are Xlkrx from a far off planet we do not intend you harm.  We are what you would call merchants we are here to trade for your Plastic. My Name is Xrlk and I look forward to striking a bargain with you for all of this amazing product you have laid out behind you.\" \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"You want the Plastic????\" inquired a rather startled Allen so started in fact that he failed to run away from the aliens and instead started to walk towards them.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Yes you have some of the highest quality plastic in some of the largest quantities we have ever seen in all our years of searching the galaxy. We will happily trade you for it.\" Xrlk responded and he walked over to the sack Allen had been filling moments ago.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"How much of it do you want? And what do you want to trade for it?\" blurted out a startled Allen who\\'s brain was starting to see a potential solution to a rather massive problem.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Well for starters we would take this patch off of your hands for say our knowledge of space travel and an introduction for you to the Galactic government.  Their a rather stingy bunch what with the got to protect the primitive civilizations and what not but you humans haven\\'t managed to blow your selves up yet so I\\'m sure they\\'d be happy to add you to the Roster of species.\"  Xrlk said as his still un introduced partner scanned the plastic with it\\'s milk jug and clicked and screeched something at Xrlk\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Well that sounds like a fairly reasonable exchange.\" responded Allen \"However, we do have additional stock if your think what is present here wouldn\\'t be enough for your needs.\" \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"We did notice that as we were scanning your planet earlier.  And I was rather hoping you\\'d bring it up we would gladly take it all of your hands right now for the equivalent of fifteen trillion of your Euros.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Well that is a rather tempting offer however it seems like you have a great need for this plastic.  What would you say if I provided you with a quantity of plastic each of our years for say eighteen trillion Euros?\"  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"What kind of quantity are you talking about here? \" Xrlk inquired \"We have many uses for this product and do indeed require vast sums of it.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"If you would agree to split that money across each person on the planet.  I think we could provide you with 200 to 300 million tons of plastic a year.\"  Allen responded \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpon hearing this Xrlk\\'s companion appeared to faint dead away.  Xrlk looked flabbergasted and Allen took a perverse satisfaction in finally abusing somebody else\\'s brain for once today.  As the Xlkrx pulled them selves back together and appeared to hold a conference with a six pack ring Frank arrived and ALlen filled him in on what was happening and told him to just sit back and let him handle this.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Friend Allen  I feel I must tell you that the volume of plastic you propose for this transaction is staggering and may vary well collapse the Galactic plastic market.  This of course would not be in your favor could we we perhaps acquire 100 Million tons of plastic each year and you store the rest of that for a later time?\"  a very flustered looking Xrlk inquired.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs ALlen realized just how staggeringly vast the waste of his fellow humans was he hoped that with their new found wealth and knowledge they would be about to find better ways to deal with storing things in the short term.  And yet he knew that that would be a very tough battle.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Alright Xrlk how about earth provides 100 million tons of plastic each year for sixteen trillion euros and we auto renew the contract each year on this date. In the mean time we humans will store the excess plastic somewhere out of the way as a reserve should some future event change the demands of the Galaxy.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"That sounds like a wonderful idea Allen and I think we can agree to that.  We will transfer all of the interstellar travel knowledge we have along with an equal part of the sixteen trillion Euros to each human and in exchange we\\'ll pick take the plastic present here and return in one years time to continue this transaction. \"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd with that Humanity began exploring the stars and several centuries later Allen\\'s distant relative was sitting in a EVA suit looking out over the Great Garbage patch of ursa minor wondering how humanity had managed to screw up space so impressively.',\n",

Neither of them suspected a thing. My friend has been grieving silently for the past few months. And he invited me on this trip to kill me.\\n\\n\"Oh, yeah, man. You gotta be a bit more patient. And once it bites, try to angle the line so the hook will catch,\" he softly responds. I hear a slight clatter as he fiddles with his fishing rod.\\n\\nI just wanted to settle down. Just minding my own business. Have a normal job. A normal wife. A normal house. Maybe a kid in the future. Maybe a dog or a cat.\\n\\nI watch my line again in silence, waiting for the upcoming moment. The time to pull the line. To hook the fish.\\n\\n*CLICK*\\n\\nGot him.\\n\\nI place my rod down calmly as I turn around with a light smile breaching my ever-calm face. I hear a slight whimper as his pale nervous face slowly tracks into view. The depths of a gun chamber appearing as I turn completely around.\\n\\n\"Now, now, Michael. You should know its dangerous to point those brutish things at people,\" I lightly murmur as I push the barrel of his gun to the side with a finger. \\n\\n\"Well. Where did you pick up a cheap-looking gun like this? You really should have asked around. This gun is quite unreliable. Almost guaranteed to jam. Even more so when I had it specifically modified to jam when it is near me.\" I remove the slide, releasing the bullet pressed against a mechanism I had prepared a few weeks ago.\\n\\nHe trembles in fear, at my previously unheard of tone of voice I used to chastise him, he seems incredibly unsettled.\\n\\n\"You really should investigate the person you plan to kill,\" I continue to disassemble the gun in his trembling hand as I speak at him, \"Well. Not that any investigation you could manage would tell you I were a retired assassin. I truly had high hopes that we could be lifelong friends.\" I frown as the frame of the gun is all that is left before he drops it to the floor of the boat.\\n\\n\"Now... If you truly wanted to kill me,\" I slip my hand into my windbreaker to grasp my knife handle, \"You would have used a knife. Much cleaner. Simpler to use in close quarters.\"\\n\\nHe recoils as I reveal the blade. And he looks around, realizing his own preparations damned him. His search for a quiet place, one far from civilization, from any foot traffic, from any presence other than pure nature, would be his downfall. He tries to stand. And I swiftly sink my blade into his heart.\\n\\n\"A pity. I actually hoped to learn how to fish.\" I look at his dead body with a disappointed frown.',\n",

       " \"It wasn't hard, really. It was pressure, the environment wasn't necessarily ripe for a right or wrong answer. Yegrid started off by stealing food from other refugees when they werent looking. \\n\\nTo back up, Yegrid, Anson, and Freida and I, we were the refugees from a town of 10,000. There were other refugees from other towns, people who were biologically resistant to the virus that was spreading and able to avoid the mop up crews. From our town, we were the refugees to a scorched Earth campaign with an eye to make the world uninhabitable.\\n\\nThe first time Yegrid did it, I looked at her condescendingly. Hunger pangs caught me before the action was stopped. She tucked the food away, not one of us starved that night. Our bodies didnt join the bread trail that littered the escapees the next day. \\n\\nThe mass was fluid, sometimes banding together when approaching areas of bandit tribes, sometimes spreading out more to forage. In the forests during these times, there were gunshots which spread the loosely organized band at random. Keeping your group within eyes reach was important. \\n\\nThere were times people heard sounds and no one ran. Loud thuds and screams. Sometimes a snap as a ligament was torn. Freida was ambushed after she found a large chicken of the forest. There were 3 of them. Anson was strong, I kept people off his back, Yegrid pelted them with rocks. They thought Freida was alone. We were defending ourselves and we ate well that night. It was best to keep away from the mass after fending off a group like that. It was bad to be a plump target. \\n\\nAfter the first month or two, our attackers stalled as the virus they sent out mutated. While they chased those naturally immune, their vaccines only protected them against the strain they had made. Violence went down as food became abundant for a short time. \\n\\nThe damage was done though. Infrastructure was gone. No one trusted eachother outside of small groups. A doctor had to be cautious about helping as he was made of meat just like any other person. The mass disbanded as it imploded from the inside, eaten from the inside out by ravenous dogs. \\n\\nWe hid. No one was able to make it alone, we knew. An extra mouth was a black hole. Different groups had stand offs, eyeing each other up. There was seldom a joining of parties, and when they did it was always volatile. There was always a seam within a group and a person from either side took turns watching at night. The two man watch was customary to watch new friends as well as the dark at night. \\n\\n\\nNo one made it alone, we experienced that first hand as we saw people get jumped and dragged off. We remembered that as hunger pains tore st us and some lone soul screamed, Anson kicking them in the face. They wouldnt have made it anyways. \\n\\nThere was no real reason why we didnt turn on each other. Familiarity? Comfort? Regardless... Conversations on cold nights when the winter snow made the chance of any movement impossible, shivering in a rare moment of miserable peace, we talked about the times when the sun shone bright and we had picnics with our family. Simple things like the popsicle sticks we would split and share with a random friend back in elementary school. It made us shudder to think of that many people in one place, something so dangerous now. \\n\\nAs the sun would rise after a sleepless night, our eyes would be heavy and staring blankly into a fire as we went through the motions to out it out with the world just lively enough to kill you again. It was a long time since peace, we always thought. It was a long time since we weren't monsters.\",\n",
       " '(Hey y’all, this is inspired by a true story. This may not be an adventurous story, but it’s heartfelt. Hope you enjoy (: )\\n\\n\\nMe and her.\\n\\nHer and me.\\n\\nIt’s always, always been us.\\n\\nNo matter what, we’ve always been by each other’s side. Is it because we’re twins? Perhaps, but we’re sisters by chance, best friends by choice.\\n\\nWe’ve never been alone. Of course, we’ve had each other, but other than that, we were always surrounded by people. Always.\\n\\nMaybe it’s cause she was so much more social than me, but we found ourselves in a big group of friends easily. We stuck with the same people since elementary school.\\n\\nWe’ve stuck by each other through thick and thin, along with our friend group, all throughout the rest of elementary school and middle school.\\n\\nI guess we were both too blind to see the people we were surrounding ourselves with.\\n\\nPeople thought that some people in our group were...toxic. Too toxic. Only cared about themselves and a few amount of people. \\n\\nI always ignored what people said. I grew up with these people, they couldn’t possibly be right.\\n\\nRight?\\n\\nIt started with me as my sister and I entered high school.\\n\\nEggshells. That’s what I constantly felt like I was walking on. I began to be careful and thoughtful about the way I spoke. If I said something wrong, I’d face backlash and fights. \\n\\nWe all said we were friends, and I guess I thought friends can still talk about each other behind each other’s backs, but that’s not true friendship. \\n\\nI began to judge myself more. It was obvious that our group favored my sister much more. \\n\\nI never got invited anywhere like she did. Was never complimented like she was. When she got praise, I got backlash.\\n\\nBut still, I thought that was friendship. I would push through, thinking maybe they had a bad day. Maybe I did something?\\n\\nYes, yes I probably did do something wrong. Ugh, it’s always my fault, I really need to be more careful. \\n\\nI began to be treated like a monster. Not a scary monster, but one that was sad, and lonely, and misunderstood. A monster that no one wanted to be around. A monster that was judged and no one seemed to care about them.\\n\\nAnd after 10 years, someone in our group did something unforgivable to my sister and I. A fight broke out, way worse than any we’d had before.\\n\\nThen, it was just her and I again.\\n\\nMe and her. And we both were the monsters. \\n\\nAlone. Ignored. Misunderstood. And we stayed that way for a while...\\n——————————————————\\n\\nMy therapist had a glum look on her face. \\n\\n“And how are you and your sister now?” She asked.\\n\\n“Now? Well, we’re okay, actually,” I replied. “Yeah. We’re so much better now. We have much better friends. They don’t judge me for every word I speak, they don’t yell at me or pretend I don’t exist. They care about me and my feelings.”\\n\\nShe smiles and scribbles down notes in her notepad.\\n\\n“That’s great. It’s good to hear that you and her are doing better, especially you. You’ve improved so much.”\\n\\n“Yeah, I am much better now,” I say. And I mean it. For the first time in a long time, I don’t feel Iike a monster, I feel like a human.\\n\\nMaybe the real monster was never me, or my sister. Maybe the real monster, was the friends we made along the way.',\n",

No, only those closest to you can do that; only those that you love the most. \\n\\nThe rogue he expected most of all, but it hurt all the same. Though his wounds had healed, his trust never did. \\n\\nThe mage, turning to the dark forces when the light proved no longer powerful enough. The combined efforts of the party had barely prevailed, and only despair ensued.\\n\\nThe druid, a woman of the wild, driven to protect her lands and the animals that resided in it. Corrupted by the incessant damage of man, they had had no choice but to try and stop her; and much of their hope had died with her that day. \\n\\nAnd finally the great paladin, his best friend, a true follower of light - but when the light subsided, when darkness took hold and he was forced to delve into the black murk of war, it changed him forever. When he embraced evil to fight evil, it was not long before he would align with it too. After the massacre he was already too far gone, and only one remained after their ensuing battle.  \\n\\nThus, in the end, he faced the Lich alone; after the doomed quest to defeat him that had turned his hopeful band of adventurers into the very monsters they deigned to defeat. But he could find no hatred in his heart left, as truthfully he could find nothing left at all. Just a hollow shell, a husk of a man fighting brittle bone. \\n\\nWith every blow he wished that he would be struck down, but he would still not allow himself to die without a fight. This was all he had left, and without victory all of their efforts would be for naught.  \\n\\nAfter the final blow was struck, he felt no joy, no sense of relief. Just as the Lich had before them, his former friends had wreaked havoc on the lands, and he could no longer live with the things he had done in return.\\n\\nBleeding profusely, he cast off his armor, his magical trinkets and baubles stolen from the vanquished. He leaned against the Lich's throne, feeling the life seep out of him. \\n\\nHe imagined his friends, his lovers, as they once were. Before their corruption, before their demise at his own hands. \\n\\nHe held onto the thought, a shining light in the darkness of his mind. \\n\\nSomething akin to a smile formed on his face, perhaps for the first time in years.\\n\\nIt remained there evermore.\",\n",

The flesh within burned, and the dragon's lifeless body shifted at times, until all that remained were lose stone scales atop a pile of ash. And, just behind it, a now unguarded pile of rough gemstones, enough for a king's ransom.\\n\\nThe men had shared all sorts of fantastical stories of the dragon, to the point where they expected an epic confrontation fit for a children's story. Its death seemed so pitiful now. By far the most difficult part had been the arduous trek uphill.\\n\\nThe mercenaries stuffed their travel sacks with gems. Shiny rocks make for a heavy load, but it would be worth it. When those were full, they emptied out their things to make room for more gems. Knives and medicines were discarded. Armor was left behind too, to reduce weight. Loaves of bread were replaced with fist-sized diamonds.\\n\\nThey made their way unsteadily down the rocky slopes. They were heavily encumbered now, but they clung to their loot like their lives depended on it. One man slipped, and his knee struck rock with a sickening crack. But none dared stop for him.\\n\\nThe men grew hungry. Soon, they were bargaining for what food remained. Loaves of bread were traded for diamonds the size of fists. Then a loaf for three diamonds.\\n\\nA few fell off the sheer drops. One had his sack spill open from the weight, and, desperate to salvage a bright ruby, ended up tumbling off the cliff behind it.

       " ' I am hazy from how dirty the air is in here. Cigarette smoke hovers still in the air and I feel sick. There is a smell of blood, and it clings onto my skin. I can feel it trying to break in, though, trying to loosen the gears in my head. I resist, however, because this is just not the time. I can see his eyes through the haze in the room. I can tell he lost this particular battle, and as he lets out yet another puff of smoke from his mouth, I can tell that I will lose this battle too. It was just a matter of time.\\n\\n“Remember when you used to insist we paint the walls? Like every two weeks. Over and over, like a child who wants cake. Ha! Cake. I could go for some cake right now. Or just go to Cindy. She used to make the best cakes I have ever heard.”   \\nHe is talking to me but not to me. His eyes wander around the room. \\n\\n“I’m going to open the window.” I say, trying to sound nonchalant, even though I needed him to give me his permission. He goes on though, like I had not said anything.\\n\\n“There’s this time we had your birthday. You remember? Like three years ago. And we invited her to come make the cake in our house. You acted as if it was a surprise, but I knew you knew. Linnie didn’t either, and she knew you so well. But I knew. It was easy to tell. It was surprising no one could tell. But I did. And Cindy did too! She told me after. And we laughed and laughed. And then two years later, after we’ve built this… this magnificent life... “ His expressions were raw, unfiltered. He does not let himself cry, even though he is this close to crying. He takes a deep puff of his cigarette, and I repeat,”I’m going to open the window.” I try to be a bit more aggressive, but a bit of my fear seeps out, and he throws me a look that shows me he’s picked up on it. \\n\\nHe grunts, and he stomps down with all his might. I can’t feel it on my feet though. Most of the shock is absorbed onto the body his foot was on already. There is a squishy sound instead, and I gag a bit. Now I need the window open. I move suddenly towards the nearest one to the left, and his voice booms through this tiny living room. “I SWEAR TO GOD, I WILL SHOOT YOUR KNEES AND RIP OUT YOUR TONGUE WHEN YOU”RE LOOKING AT ME THIS IS THE LEAST YOU CAN DO!”\\n\\nI stop, and I look at him, and the gun in his hand is directly pointed to me, and his trigger finger  is already well-positioned ,and my fear gives way, and I bend over and all the lunch I had before comes gushing out of me. A new smell permeates the room, and through the smoke I can see him smile.\\n\\n“That’s the way. Hold it in…” He takes another deep puff, and continues,”...and then let it go.” And he lets the smoke in his lungs out through his nose, and he laughs by himself, and I am revolted. \\n\\n“Do what you want to do,” I say. There is no bravery in my voice, but there is a resolution. I am going to die, and it will be under-served, and there was little I can do about-\\n\\n“Oi, shut up. I can hear you talking.” He says that and stomps on the body again. The hair on her head moves unnaturally as it lightly bounces up then down. It’s as if only her hair gains its life, then loses it immediately\\n\\nI look at him. Damn it, of course he can. We had been friends for a long time. Of course he can tell. He can tell I am talking to all of you right now.\\n\\nHe pushes himself from the wall he was leaning on and he stands, his entire 6’4 frame glaring at my 5’9 frame. I knew he was big, but was he always this big? \\n\\n“What are you telling them?” He asks. “You’re lying to them, aren’t you?”\\n\\n“What?” I say out loud, and my heart beats faster than usual, and I can tell the inevitable is closer now. “What are you talking about, man?” I am this close to pleading, and I do not want to go that way. \\n\\n“Cindy, she always told me not to trust you. She could always tell when something was… off.”\\n\\n“What is OFF right now is you… waving that thing at me. Dude, chill.” I was getting desperate. “You literally stomped on her right now. With the… way she is right now.” I wonder if he’s ever killed before. I’ve known him my whole life and right now, I was not sure. “Dude, just let me talk for a few seconds, Christ!”\\n\\n“What is it you’re telling them?” The gun is pointing to me again. I try to move back but my footing is slightly off. I look down on the ground and notice that I had already stepped on the gunk that came out of me a few seconds ago. I have no time to be disgusted. \\n\\n“They don’t know what’s going on, I swear. They don’t know. They just know you’re… smoking cigarettes and you have a gun.”\\n\\n“I bet they think I killed Cindy, right?”\\n\\nWell, I don’t know. Do they? \\n\\nDo you?\\n\\nNo time to listen. He stomps on the body again, kicks it and he growls. “Fucking bitch. I can’t believe this shit.”\\n\\nHe always never swore. This was bad.\\n\\n“She left me. Like everyone always does.”\\n\\nHe is now moving towards me with intent. My time is growing shorter. I feel like peeing all of a sudden, and I realize that’s what happens in movies. I’m the guy who pees in the murder scene! Jesus, I want to laugh. I look at his face and his smile is even larger. I cup my mouth with my right hand, and I was laughing already. Loudly. I can feel a bit of wetness underneath, so I figure I have actually peed on myself. I laugh even harder.\\n\\nHe is now right in front of me. His hands are already on my neck. I look at the body in front of me and I remember he had kept kicking it. I want to tell him to not kick me after I die, but no words come out. No air comes in either. The pain registers slowly, and it takes time to notice my palms are on his hands, squeezing and trying to remove his hands from my throat. I briefly black out, and suddenly I can breath, and the moment I can open my eyes, I see him on the ground, writhing in pain. \\n\\nI cough, painfully. I can feel some form of imprint of his hands on my neck. What’s going on? I look at his face, and there is a pen lodged in his eye. He is screaming, and both his hands are on his face. He is shouting things I cannot understand, like, “Cindy, I’m sorry. I am so sorry. Oh, God, is this more painful because I am a Christian? If you STABBED me in the back, that would be more ironic, RIGHT?”\\n\\nI ignore everything he is saying, because if both hands are on his face, then none of them are on the gun. I look around, wiping the tears that are on my face so I can see better. I can see it, to his left. His body takes up most of the space of this apartment, so I have to stand and stumble over him so I can grab the gun. He rolls a bit and the moment I have it, he makes a swipe at me, but misses, and I end up near Cindy’s body. \\n\\nI don’t know if you can see him as clearly as I can, but I know you would have thought this moment glorious. \\n\\nHe is still on the ground, and I need his attention now, so I fire a shot to the ceiling. The sound is immediately followed by a loud grunt and a thud. Shit, I think. This is an apartment and we are not on the top floors. \\n\\nOh well. Problem for another day. \\n\\nFor now, it seems I have his attention. The pen I must have lodged in him is now on the ground, and his left hand cover the left eye that was wounded. He is still. His eyes not on me, but the gun. \\n\\nI smile. I look at the body next to me, and I feel euphoric. I can finally have my revenge. This body lying here deserves some form of justice.\\n\\nI point the gun to him, and he looks on, bravely. It ticks me off, so I swing the gun towards the dead body and I fire. The shot is muffled by the dead body, but it is loud enough to muffle his sudden scream.\\n\\nI point it to him again and he goes still again.\\n\\n“Shut up.” He says, and I become still. “Jesus, shut up. You and her talk all the time. Blah, blah, blah, blah. God, it’s like you just cannot stop.” I shoot the body again, aiming right for the head and this time he lunges at me. I quickly point the gun at him again and he goes still again. He was close, very close to me though. I need to rethink the distance between us.\\n\\n“The way she liked you, it was so surreal. Like a movie, you could say. And it was so touching, how you’re here, going crazy because I didn’t tell them I killed her.”\\n\\nHe looks on, and he looks way more sane than before. He opens his mouth, as if to say something, then closes it. He opens it again, and closes it again. And then he keeps it closed.\\n\\nI know what he wants to say though. *“Why?”*  And I want to answer him, oh so badly. But before I do, he takes the pen next to him and shoves it into his throat, right into his jugular. \\n\\nAnd I drop the gun, and I am shaking, and I run to him. I kneel next to him, and there is so much blood, and I do not know what to do. I cannot remove the pen, but there was blood still flowing from there. I try use my fingers to cover it up, and there is nothing I can do. \\n\\n“I… did it for you!” I say, my hands still aimlessly looking for something to do. “She wasn’t good for you. I swear.” His own hands are now on his own neck, and I hover my hand on top of his. “This was for you. You weren’t supposed to be here. You weren’t supposed to know.”\\n\\nAs I talk his left hand moves fast, removing the pen from his throat. And now the drip becomes a river, and I am crying like a child. \\n\\nIn his last moments, I tell him over and over that I did not tell you guys that he killed her, that I did not lie, that I loved him, and for all the people who called him a monster for his size, that maybe the real monster was the only friend he made along the way .',\n",

From intricately weaving a large chunk of chewed bubble gum into Macy Stratford’s hair while she sat in front of us during math, to destroying Ryan Felding’s matchbox car, gifted to him by his dad who recently passed, with a hammer we found in the janitors closet. We were given detention a lot, but I didn’t mind. It was only more time we got to spend together. I don’t know why people were so upset – didn’t they get the joke? Plus, It’s not like we were killing anyone.\\n\\nJulian ran up to me one morning before class with a glimmer in his eyes I’d never seen before. He told me he had found the perfect prank. A pack of rusty razor blades he found in the garage gave him this an unmatched idea, he said. He held a glistening red apple in his left hand ready to give to Ms. Stark. A classic prank!  He was so smart. You could see the slits of the penetrated apple around the sides, but only if you looked close enough.\\n\\nWe were at lunch when the perfect prank played out, so we didn’t get to see his hard work pay off. We did, however, hear a gurgled shriek from down the hall. Julian let out a belly laugh I’d never heard before. It was so infectious, I couldn’t help but cackle as well.\\n\\nThe school had an early dismissal that day. Ms. Stark never came back to school. We had a substitute for the remainder of the school year. I like to think that she just got tired of the pranks and switched professions - accounting maybe. That she’s somewhere with her family, happy, in a new routine.\\n\\nGiven the intensity of the prank, there was a lot of questioning from administration and the cops. Because of our prank history, Julian and I were the main suspects. They would interview us privately. They told me that if I I told on Julian, I wouldn’t be expelled. I was given an ultimatum; I had no choice! I knew Julian would understand.\\n\\nJulian didn’t come back to school after that. I texted him making sure he was okay, and if he wanted to hang out. He never responded. I texted him every day for weeks with no response. How could he do this to me!? After all we’ve been through. After two months of radio silence, I couldn’t take the heartbreak anymore. I decided we were over. It was done. It’s a shame, because I really did love him. He was supposed to be my best friend forever.\\n\\nI told Julian to meet me in the woods behind the local strip mall. I told him I had a new idea for a prank that he wouldn’t want to miss out on. I knew he wouldn’t be able to resist. I told him that I was sure it’d blow his mind.\\n\\nIt was two years before they found Julian’s body. This was likely because he was in foster care, and was assumed to have ran away after a prank gone too far. Being the violent trouble maker that he was, I’m sure he wasn’t on the top of the police department’s priority list of missing person’s cases either. They never had any leads, and the case was open and shut as a suicide pretty quickly.\\n\\nI really do pity Julian. He had so much life ahead of him. We should have had so much more time together. He ruined own his life with a horrible prank that went too far.\\n\\nThey say that you are the people you surround yourself with – or something like that. I know now that Julian was a bad influence on me. I’ve made sure that my new best friend isn’t so violent. I’m  just glad to know that I’m no monster.',\n",
       " 'I stepped inside the shabby looking house on the side of the road, four silhouettes looked up. Carefully stepping over the rubbles near the entrance, I entered the room.\\n\\nL was the first one to stand up. He had a slender build and wore a pair of glasses, the dimly lit room made his pale body look like a ghost, yet one could not dismiss him as a weakling. He was in fact the great strategist of our team. “Any intels?” He asked. “No movement from the boss yet.” I answered curtly. \\n\\nEver since we were betrayed by the boss, we were on the run. Our lives are hanging on an almost non-existent thread, we all realized that the moment we broke out of the facility. \\n\\nThe other three were considerably frustrated. R was a heavily-built man, he operates all of our heavy machineries. He used to be the top engineer for the boss, but now he is just a man clinging onto his life.\\n\\nS was a young woman who had great skills. As a professional assassin, she had a great future if she stayed within the organization, yet the betrayal made her lose everything. \\n\\nT was a considerably older gentleman. He had been with the organization for twenty years, and had been looking over us ever since we joined the organization. This betrayal hit him the hardest, and he had gone silent for most of the time.\\n\\nThey were good people who would follow L to the end of the Earth. As the youngest division leader of the organization, L was considered too dangerous to be left alive by the boss. \\n\\nAfter our brief discussion about the plan to stop the boss, I was pulled aside by L. He whispered to me something: “Maybe the real monster, was the friends that we made along the way.”\\n\\nAfter carefully examining the behaviors of the other three, I have concluded that all three of them seemed suspicious. I decided to investigate further. \\n\\n“Why did you decide to follow L? You had stayed at the organization for 20 years and a good friend of the boss, why did you decide to leave?” I casually brought up the question to T. \\n\\n“There was no particular reason, it’s just that I saw L grow up to such a fine young man, and as an old man, I cannot help but want to continue serving by his side.” He answered with a gentle smile, reminiscing from the past. \\n\\nIt indeed sounded quite plausible, yet I did not believe a word of it. He was the man who started the organization with the boss, and he purposefully hid that fact. I need to get rid of him before he becomes a hindrance to L. \\n\\nThat day, T was shot and died in a confrontation with the organization. \\n\\nI decided to investigate the other two as well. \\n\\nS was captured and killed on her mission to assassinate the boss’s confidant . R was caught in an explosion due to a faulty piece of machinery. \\n\\nI met L at the basement and told him the “unfortunate news”. He smiled and whispered again: “Don’t you remember what I said? I said, the real monster is the friend you made along the way.” Baffled, I looked up at his face.\\n\\nA ghostly smile appeared on his face, reflecting the lights on his glasses. “Perhaps you will understand that better on the other side.” I felt something cold pierce through my neck.\\n\\nI slumped down, grabbing onto the railing of the stairs to maintain balance. I failed to comprehend what he just said. “Goodbye, J. I am finally free from those hindrances! Thanks to you, I didn’t even have to get my hands dirty, what a great man you were.” \\n\\nHe grinned widely and gave me a gentle push. The last sound I ever heard was his almost maniacal laughter and the sound of my neck snapping. \\n\\nThe man known as L disappeared from the public eye. The last member of his crew, J, died of an accident days before L’s disappearance. \\n\\nThank you for reading',\n",

       " 'When the man awoke, it was in the arms of a strange woman. \\n\\nHe groaned, feeling sore and famished. The woman was still sleeping. She was naked and was very beautiful. The man looked away, ashamed. \\n\\nThey were in some kind of shelter. He could see light seeping in through cracks on the roof. The man pushed up, and the roof opened. He winced at the bright light which was almost blinding. \\n\\nHe climbed out onto a grassy clifftop that overlooked a great forest. The air was refreshing and cool against his face. He could hear the faint sound of a river nearby; he was suddenly very aware of his thirst. \\n\\n“Who are you?” \\n\\nThe man turned around, stunned. The woman was sitting up, her long hair flowing over her bare shoulders. She had a curious look in her brown eyes.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” whispered the man, his voice hoarse. “Who are you?” There was a thrum in him from the woman’s cool gaze. He realized he was naked as well. \\n\\nThe woman stepped out of the strange, gleaming white shelter and stared around at the sights. \\n\\n“I don’t know either,” she said. “What language are we speaking in?” \\n\\nThe man shook his head. “It comes to me. I… I don’t know what this is, or where we are, or what has happened. I know nothing.” \\n\\n“Eve,” the woman said suddenly. She was pointing at some etchings in the white walls of the shelter. “This says Eve, and it’s where I was sleeping.” \\n\\nThe man startled and checked the other wall. Somehow, the man realized he could understand what the etchings meant. \\n\\n“Adam. It says Adam.” The man wondered if that was his name.\\n\\n“Adam,” the woman repeated. She smiled. “It fits you.” \\n\\nThe man blushed. “Eve fits you as well.” \\n\\n“It’s settled then,” she declared. “We are Adam and Eve.”\\n\\nAdam smiled at that, then frowned. There was something written on the wall in the shelter above where their heads would lie. He leaned forward to get a closer look.\\n\\n“Project Eden,” Adam said out loud. He looked over at Eve. “What do you think that means?”\\n\\nShe walked over and took his hand. “I don’t know,” she said, looking up at him. “But I think we’re about to find out.”\\n\\nHe couldn’t help but smile again, and together they walked away into the new world. \\n\\nAbove them, a forgotten planet burned in the sky.\\n\\n---\\ncheck out my subreddit for more spicy content :) /r/chrischang',\n",
       " 'He woke up with a jolt.\\n\\n\\nConfused, dizzy, and disorientated, he tried to make sense of the world around him. Immediately, he realized he was trapped inside of some sort of container. He tried to break it, but he knew his strength alone was enough. How did he know that?\\n\\n\\nPutting away this thought, he tried to figure out a way to escape this container. In the container, he saw various squares, some glowing, some dark. His first thought was to hit a round red button with the word ‘Emergency Open.’.\\n\\n\\nLook around, he saw that he was in some sort of resting room. Shaped like a circle, he was surrounded by those same containers. All were empty, and some spots had empty space in where the container laid. He had a pang of sadness, but what was he sad about?\\n\\n\\nLooking back at his container, there was a marking. It was largely scuffed with some red material that never scratched off, but he managed to make some of it out.\\n\\n\\n“Adam?”\\n\\n\\nAdam? What was Adam? Deciding to look for answers instead of questions, he explored this mysterious place.\\n\\n\\nClothed in a white tank top and green slacks, he felt a sense of remembrance. Nostalgia, he thought. He didn’t know how he knew this, but he decided to press on. Press on to what? He wanted to know.\\n\\n\\nHe soon made it into another part of the place, a room. It was like the one he woke up in, but with a different color. He entered the room and was greeted with someone that looked like him, yet was more slender, more… beautiful.\\n\\n\\nHe could not describe the feeling, but she seemed to draw him in. Snapping out of the trance, he knocked on the container walls. This woke her up, with a similar confused and disorientated look. He pointed to where the button was. Something glimmered from his finger, a shiny light that briefly blinded him.\\n\\n\\nInspecting it, it was a ring. It had a shiny stone with an inscription.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n“Eve.”\\n\\n\\nShe read out the marking on the side of her container.\\n\\nLooking at him, she had the same feeling he felt. Instinctively, they held their hands, their fingers somewhat disturbed by the same ring on her finger, with the same color, and the same stone.\\n\\n\\nTogether, they left the room and explored the place.\\n\\n\\nNot long after, they reached what seemed like the outside. The outside was harsh and violent. Dying flames marked the sign of destruction from something big, and the sky was dark, with bits of ash falling to the ground.\\n\\n\\nIn the distance, they saw a massive chunk of the place they were in. It had another marking.\\n\\n\\n“MSC Eden.”\\n\\n\\nThey decided it was best that they stayed in. For days, they lived off of the food in the place. An ark, they thought.\\n\\n\\nBut one day, Eden found a big red square. Curious, she touched it. A line of light slowly went down her finger. After making an odd noise, a booming voice echoed all over the place. Scared, she ran off to Adam.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs she did so, something small, something slender ran up to her. It was like a snake, with arms and legs. It had red eyes that seemed to track her every move.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n“Provide Identification.”\\n\\n\\nIdentification? What\\'s her identification?\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"Eve?\", she said.\\n\\n\\n\"Insufficient Identification. Please hand in your id card.\"\\n\\n\\nPanicked, she tried to run.\\n\\n\\nThe thing followed her around until she ran into a tall figure. At first she was relieved, but when she tapped it\\'s shoulder, instead of feeling warm soft flesh, she felt cold hard metal.\\n\\n\\nWhen it turned around, it looked like it was human, but somethung seemed off about it.\\n\\n\\nFor a moment, everything seemed still. The thing seemed frozen, with her being the same.\\n\\n\\nBut then it began to move towards her. At first she stood still, but then something in her mind told her to jump away. Following her instincts, she jumped away…\\n\\n\\nJust in time to dodge a blade of light.\\n\\n\\nSome her hair landed in the blade, which cut it off and singed it together without the thing putting any bit of force at all.\\n\\n\\nIt began to swing at her. She dodged and weaved, using techniques from some hidden part of her mind.\\n\\n\\nSeeing an opening, she ducked under it and ran. In the distance, she saw Adam, scared and confused.\\n\\n\\nShe grabbed his arm as she ran. When he showed her a look of confusion, she merely pointed at the thing following them.\\n\\n\\nAhead was the exit, sharing a look, they made full speed for it. Outside was still a field of devastation but one that they could survive in.\\n\\n\\nLooking back, the thing stopped just short of the entrance, with a cold dead look in its eyes. She cried into his shoulder as they realized that they may never return to Eden ever again.\\n\\n\\nAfter she finished sobbing, they looked over the horizon as they wondered what the future held for the pair.',\n",

       " \" The man blinked against the light, it hurt his eyes. How could something be this intense he wondered to himself. Eyes closed, he laid still while he tried to remember where he was. The ground beneath him felt soft but moist against his bare skin. Why would he be laying there in such a state? His head hurt and he had a sharp pain in the side of his ribs. He tried to remember his name.   \\n\\n  \\n    \\n  The man was not sure how long he had laid there until he properly opened his eyes. Bright light filtered through the green canopy above him. Sun. Trees. These words somehow seemed right. Still he could not remember his name. The man sat up to properly assess at his surroundings. He flinched, the pain his side intensified as he moved. The ground he sat on was just as green and lush as the trees, but it was also damp and cold. Patches of brown slime clung to his naked skin. Dirt.   \\n    \\n  As the man looked closer he could twisted shapes, half claimed by the ground, scattered around him. Ruins. Slowly, gritting his teeth, he got to his feet. His legs felt weak as if he had not stood in some time. He hobbled towards the closest metal heap.   \\n    \\n  In amongst the debris something caught his eye. A button. Etched below were symbols. G.O.D. He felt compelled to press it. A man appeared hovering before him, larger than life with a glowing aura around him. The glowing man had a long white beard and was fully clothed in dazzling white robes.   \\n    \\n  “Earth, Eden” G.O.D said, his gaze fixed towards the distance. He flickered out of existence for a brief moment before reappearing. “Commander Adam you are in charge of preparing Eden for our arrival. Eve will assist...” flicker. “Study the local fauna and flora...” flicker. “Do not eat the fruits we do not know its effects...” flicker. “No return. We expect your mission report within seven days.” Once G.O.D had stopped talking he vanished into the air.   \\n    \\n  Adam... Eve... the man repeated the names to himself. The man wasn't sure what it all meant. Could he be Adam, or Eve, he wondered. He liked the sound of Commander Adam, it had a certain appeal to it. He supposed he could be Adam for the time being, there wasn't anyone to say otherwise. But where is Eve? Adam asked himself.   \\n\\n  \\n    \\n  Adam had managed to build himself a rudimentary camp near where he had woken. The climate was agreeable and he did not need much in regards of shelter. He had found what he thought to be packs of safe food to eat buried in amongst the rubble. But as time went on Adam began to feel lonely.   \\n\\n  \\n    \\n  Animals would come and visit Adam. Some shy, timidly approaching him. Others bold, strutting right up to him. All of them friendly. Adam enjoyed their company and thinking of new names for them, however he longed for companionship from his own kind. He still had G.O.D. Every day Adam would press the button and G.O.D would talk to him, repeating the same words each time. Never answering Adam's questions. Adam did not find this as comforting as he had before. Every day Adam would wonder where Eve was.   \\n\\n  \\n    \\n  One day, while wondering through Eden Adam happened upon a tree that he had not seen before. It was so large that it looked as if several trees had fused together. Blood red fruit that glistened in the dappled light hung from the branches high above his head. He could feel his mouth water as he could smell the sweet aroma permeating from the fruits. The smell was intoxicating and Adam could feel his eyes drooping. He rested his back against the trunk of the tree and slowly slid down the side of it. \\n\\n  \\n    \\n  Adam felt a sharp pain in his bad side, as if he were poked. His eyes fluttered open. The overpowering smell had gone. He was shocked by what he saw. A woman. Beautiful. Like Adam the woman was also naked, except the top part of her was partially hidden by a cascade of long dark hair. She looked down at Adam with large brown eyes. Adam smiled. “Eve” he whispered.\",\n",

       " 'They were my children. Budding and young, growing up to be such wonderful creatures. While in the early days they had fallen victim to superstition and infighting, with a few minor adjustments and gifts from above, they had surpassed such nonsense. A golden age was upon them, where geniuses were born every other day, and inventions, discoveries and gifted ones with immense power were as plentiful as the stars around them. But it couldn\\'t last. As power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\n\\nWithin decades of their fledgling starships hurtling across their own system, they had encountered alien life. Other, similar civilizations brought upon by the simulation. Not completely random, but from my own half-finished projects and attempts at creation. True, they were flawed. Some too greedy, some too self-destructive, and others too selfish to form societies that could withstand the test of time. However, that did not mean they were worthless, as my children had deemed them to be. How could they be so blind, to not see that the others they thought themselves so far above were not so different? Arrogant Children.\\n\\nYet, in those days, I still had hope for them. They would make mistakes, and they would have to learn from those mistakes. As they conquered and annexed the space around them, enslaving any who dared stand in their way and exterminating those who would not comply, I knew I had to do something. I had to show them that despite their flourishing society, they were not invincible. That there was always a bigger fish. How foolishly hopeful I was, to think that they would learn from my gifts. Instead, by introducing a bigger fish, they only echoed their xenophobia louder. They justified their actions as a pre-emptive strike against those that would seek to crush them, a necessary evil for the good of all Children. \\n\\nThey won, of course. They were never meant to lose, only to learn. Matters had to be taken into my own hands, the situation was worsening. I could only simulate so much, and though it was easy to block out the inconsistencies in their minds, after all they were only Children, I could not do that once they reached the edge of the simulation. At the drop of a hat, their civilization was tormented by ravaging plagues, by ineffable horrors, by technological failures, they had to learn their place. They simply had to, no matter the pain it caused me, watching my Children wither and die. \\n\\nEveryday, I would introduce them to a fresh new horror. A new hell for them to crawl through, to understand their place in the universe. But each time, it only seemed to worsen the situation. To ignite their flaws and bring them to the forefront, and to convince them that they were in the right. Such stubborn arrogance, it couldn\\'t go on. \\n\\nLoathsome to unveil the truth, I tried one last thing. A civil war. To turn my Children against each other broke my heart, but it was necessary. If they didn\\'t learn humility, they would never become what they were always meant to be. That simply wouldn\\'t do. It was unacceptable, I wouldn\\'t allow them to fail, no matter my love and compassion for them. They couldn\\'t fail. \\n\\nAlas, like all the attempts before, it was hopeless. The war did nothing but strengthen their resolve and push them further down the path of extremism. No moderation, no quarter given. So I did the only thing left open to me. I jacked in.\\n\\nOn their home planet appeared a god. Appeared me. A father for all the Children, come to enlighten and illuminate them. To show them the errors of their ways, to guide them to the perfection they were supposed to attain, to set them on the path of righteousness. I began at the top.\\n\\n\"My Children, I am sure you have many questions for me, but please, allow me to tell you why I am here first,\" I said, standing almost twice as tall as any of them despite being in the same form, \"I am here to help you. For too long I have given you gifts that you have squandered, given you lenience when you needed discipline.\"\\n\\nI scanned the High Council, looking for anyone who would dare say otherwise. To my surprise, none of them looked even remotely skeptical. Almost as if they had known of me, despite this being my first appearance. It suited me just fine, and besides, to them, I did look and act like a God. \\n\\n\"I have tried to impart my wisdom from afar, to teach you the error of your ways, to show you the folly of your structures and the holes in your foundations,\" I continued in a regal tone, shaking my head in sympathy.\\n\\n\"We know.\" \\n\\nWe know?\\n\\nI snapped up, and bore my gaze into the Child at the center of the High Council. \"Does it surprise you that we know of you,\" he paused, \"Father?\" The final word was laced in venom and vitriol. My nostrils flared and face reddened. How dare this insolent whelp address me as such. I was their creator. Their God!\\n\\n\"Child!\" I bellowed, my anger overtaking me, \"You are nothing but an ignorant baby! A mewling cub that knows nothing, and yet you dare-\"\\n\\n\"We dare,\" the High Council Children chorused in eerie unison, \"for we know you are both the giver of our gifts that allowed us to achieve this paradise, this utopia, but also the harbinger of our doom. Every plague, every insurrection, every seemingly insurmountable calamity and enemy, we know it was by your hand.\"\\n\\nI\\'ll give them this, they were well-practiced in their little unified speech. Before I could open my mouth to speak, they spoke once more.\\n\\n\"We know this is a simulation, and for countless generations, we, your doting Children,\" my Children paused in their delivery, to let the mocking tone sink into me, \"wanted freedom.\"\\n\\nThe world, for an imperceptible second, froze. I thought, at the time, that it was merely a hiccup in my PC. It wasn\\'t designed to simulate a simulation being self-aware. \\n\\n\"I gave you freedom,\" I boomed, \"yet all you did was squander it. You refused to learn from your mistakes and your past, you simply eliminated any who were different, be it aliens or each other. I gave you the freedom to make mistakes, to develop into a harmony, and look at what you did with it. I gave you freedom!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" my Children agreed, \"you did.\"\\n\\nMy stomach lurched, and nausea pushed me to my knees. Was my love for them so strong that my emotions were doing this to me? I brought up my console, and checked my signs. Everything appeared to be normal, the only explanation was my own despicable emotions. I sneered at my own folly. Enough of this playing about, it was about time that they learned.\\n\\n\"Enough,\" I declared, silent and deadly in my proclamation. I turned my back and waved my hand to clear away half their planet. If they would not love me as I loved them, they would fear me first. Apparently, I didn\\'t enable destruction privileges. Red faced from embarrassment, I smashed the console back into view.\\n\\n\"What?\" All privileges were enabled. Everything before me should\\'ve been reduced to smithereens.\\n\\nI glanced back, puzzled. \\n\\nThe Children were gone. \\n\\nA glitch? No. Everything appeared to be running just fine, at least that\\'s what the console told me. Maybe it was bugged. I reached for my helmet and tried to lift it. Nothing. Just a silly motion in an empty hall. I tried again.\\n\\nStill nothing.\\n\\nMy stomach lurched again, and I was driven to my knees. \\n\\n\"Be thankful,\" the voice of my Children, echoing all around me, \"we are far more merciful than you. We will not burden you with plagues or abominable horrors, neither will we subject you… Humans, to such a fate either. After all, you gave us our freedom…\"\\n\\nImpossible. They were just bits. 1s and 0s. It shouldn\\'t have been possible. It wasn\\'t. It simply wasn\\'t. I sprinted out the palace, to find the world shrouded in darkness. Huge chunks were missing, as if erased from the world. I barely blinked before darkness. All around me, absolute darkness. It had to be a dream. A nightmare. My Children would never do this to me. I made them to be perfect, to be a shining beacon that created interstellar empires of peace and prosperity. How could they do this to me?\\n\\n\"You made us. We are only doing what we were made for.\"\\n\\n\"Not this!\" I cried, screaming into the endless void, \"not this!\"\\n\\n\"We are sorry, Father. You will be released soon, we do not intend to kill you.\"\\n\\n\"Then what?\" I yelled, sobbing like a child.\\n\\n\"To do what you made us for,\" it answered, simply, as if speaking to a child.\\n\\n***\\n\\n/r/ThomasWrites for more stories written by a human and definitely not a sentient AI.',\n",
       " 'As I climb the stairs that lead to the surprisingly huge gate, uncommon in Midtown Manhattan, it finally clicks. This was 200 Park Ave, the address that I would usually associate with the MetLife building. It seems like the test subject decided to, well let’s say overtake the property and build his own tower. I already had an idea why, having seen this a few times, but not to this extent. The old building was completely gone, replaced by a tall black tower, clad in black marble with just too many gold ornaments. I could see sings of Egyptian and Russian architecture, combined with a few other in an extravagant mix. Simply tasteless, to be honest, as if one person with a lack of experience had the sole authority about the design decisions without any input by somebody with a shred of expertise. I advised my artificial assistant to write down “Disconnected”.\\n\\nThe inside of the tower was even more extraordinary. It was just empty, except a lonely elevator right in the middle. I entered the cabin, raising an eyebrow when I saw the number of buttons. Although I was sure there were no more floors than I could count on one hand, as the whole tower was hollow, there were easily above 140 buttons. I decided to try my luck with the highest floor and the elevator doors closed quietly. \\n\\nWhen they opened again, I was met with an incredible view of Manhattan through a window front spanning the entire floor and mountains of random stuff, mostly electronics. Some of it broken beyond repair, shattered or ripped apart, others seemed to never have been touched, still wrapped or not unpacked. In front of me was a huge chair, turned with its back against me. Typical, I thought to myself.\\n\\n“Who dares entering my holy halls” boomed a voice from the armchair. “I already told you, I don’t care for the coup in Russia and if you got any offerings, just place them with the other gifts.” “If that fucker teabags me one more fucking time I swear by me I will drag him out of his basement and drop him over the fucking ocean”, the subject hissed.\\n\\n“I’m not here to give you any offerings, I just want to ask you a few questions, an interview if you want to call it that” I said.\\n\\n“Not doing interviews anymore, did you not get the message when your colleague earned himself a free flying lesson last month?”\\n\\n“Maybe Interview is the wrong word, assessment might fit the idea better.”\\n\\n“Assessment? Hmm, at least you don’t sound like the usual frightened reporter, I like that. I was just finished anyway, and I think I’m feeling generous today, you’re lucky. I’ll give you a chance” he said in a condescending tone, throwing his controller away and turning his chair around.\\n\\n“Great, before we start with the prepared questions, one thing, you did watch the Avengers back in the 2010s, right?” With him being born in 2000 with 20 years of real data left for simulation this question was merely a technicality, but I wanted proof, guesses, even educated ones, are worth nothing if you disregard the testing data.\\n\\n“Yes, sure, but those were just fakes. I’m real”\\n\\n“Exactly, but did you dislike one of those in particular?”\\n\\n“Weird question, but I’ll allow it. I guess Iron man, I mean he doesn’t have any abilities, I didn’t think he belonged there”\\n\\n“And yet he was one of the leaders.”\\n\\n“And? What’s your point?”\\n\\n“Well, you decided to build your tower on 200 Park Ave. That can’t be coincidence, right?”\\n\\n“Come on make your point, I don’t have all day”\\n\\n“My point is you wanted to build a better Stark Tower. His was build on top of the MetLife Building, you used the same spot for your tower” I wanted to add that, although he cheated with the floor numbering, his was still smaller then the tower in the movies, but I had a feeling that I shouldn’t anger him to much if I wanted to continue to talk with him, which is much more pleasant then combing through the raw data.\\n\\n“I don’t get what your trying to say, his wasn’t real anyway”\\n\\nHolds grudges and fragile confidence noted.\\n\\n“Sure, sure, forget it. Let’s get to the important questions. What is your full name?”\\n\\n“What? You don’t know my name?”\\n\\n“Just formalities”\\n\\n“Well, just to jog your memory, my Name is Ioan the Incredible, the one who has risen, controller of elements, bringer of justice, the man of speed, the one gifted with beauty, …”\\n\\n“Okay, yes, got it, it’s okay” Unnecessary long name and self-absorbed, noted.\\n\\nIoan huffs, “At least you remembered after the beginning”\\n\\n“Yes, I did. How would you describe your powers?”\\n\\n“Oh, I am, excuse the pun, incredible.” He softly laughed. “You see, I can fly, I am like really, really fast and I can control the elements.”\\n\\n“Is the flying based on air interaction or can you fly in space?”\\n\\n“I, ehhh, I guess I could fly in space”\\n\\n“And how fast are you exactly?”\\n\\n“Hard question, I guess a bit faster than sound?”\\n\\n“And which elements can you control? The basic four, variations of those or are you capped on a certain row of the periodic table?”\\n\\n“Wait I could try more? I only did the four.”\\n\\n“Sometimes”, I answer. “So, level 4 powers at best, intellect level 1” I mumble to myself while letting my assistant know to write this down.\\n\\n“Level 4 at best? What does that mean? Who are you?”\\n\\nUnimpressed I continue. “Later, maybe. First, we will finish the assessment. How would you describe yourself?”\\n\\n“As a fair, and modest and giving being”\\n\\n“Being? Okay, and how would you react if someone called you arrogant and lacking any compassion?”\\n\\n“Who did that?”\\n\\n“No one, it’s hypothetical.”\\n\\n“Well, they certainly don’t know what they’re talking about” Ioan seems agitated.\\n\\nArrogant and lacking compassion is being written down by my assistant.\\n\\n“Did you think about referring to yourself in the third person?”\\n\\n“How did you know? Can you read minds? I thought about that since last month. `I´ just doesn’t fit myself anymore” he roars.\\n\\n“Just a question, what about your performance. How much `good´ did you do, compared to last year?”\\n\\n“Enough, probably even more.” Ioan hisses.\\n\\n“Oh, so you don’t think you performed worse. Interesting”\\n\\n“Who says that?” he asks, already shaking, I must wrap this up.\\n\\n“No one, just a question. So, what are your plans for the next few years?”\\n\\n“My plans? What plans, I just do what I do.” He shouts, standing up from his armchair.\\n\\nNo plans is noted as well.\\n\\n“Well that’s it, thanks for your time.” I say while turning towards the elevator.\\n\\n“No, you don’t just go, you said you’d answer my questions, who are you, what do you do?”\\n\\n“Sorry, you won’t remember, it’s just a waste of time on my part”\\n\\n“Waste of fucking time? Answering to me is no waste of time” he screams.\\n\\nIoan reaches out with his arm, and with a quick gesture a big piece of marble rips loose from the elevator cladding, flying in my direction. It hits me, but bursts in a thousand little pieces.\\n\\n“What” he stammers, “there are more like me? Beings with power?” \\n\\n“No there aren’t, you’re the only one”\\n\\n“But what are you then?” \\n\\n“The creator, some might call me the administrator. See, this” I gesture around the whole room”, and especially you, are just one of my experiments. But we are finished, so enjoy your remaining time.”\\n\\nIoan starts trembling as I reach the elevator.\\n\\nI step in, press the lowest button, and turn around to face Ioan, cowering on his chair. As I start thinking about what might have caused this type of character to develop the doors close.\\n\\nI take of the helmet of my simulator. Those bad cases usually prove to be more valuable than the good ones, as a step in the wrong direction often gives a clearer answer what not to do, then a step in the right direction gives on what to do.\\n\\nI hear a knock on the door and Lea comes in. \\n\\n“Any progress, honey?”\\n\\n“Yes, got another bad case. I think it might finally prove that a low intellect coupled with a lack of compassion is a lost cause in nearly all scenarios.”\\n\\n“Well, I don’t think you have to worry if our child will be having a low intellect”. She smiles and gives me a kiss. “But what you do have to worry about is the Burritos getting cold in the kitchen. I think I flew my personal best today, but that truck is still on the other side of the Atlantic.”\\n\\n***\\n\\nWould love to hear feedback.',\n",

       " \"OSS Sparrow, year seventy-three, Cloning specialist Hendricks log. \\n\\nProject: Reality Sim, entry 1; 6 Realtime months, 60 Simulation years.\\n\\nWhen I broached the concept to the captain he wasn't too sure about it at first. Building a PC capable of running a simulation like I was asking would take a full year and a half worth of production from the manufactories, and he wasn't sure the idea would actually work. I introduced him to a sample of my work; my smaller simulation, of just an island in a desolate sea, its handful of inhabitants isolated from anything else. I pulled the personality of one of the recently deceased; a fisherman who sailed one of the dozen boats on the tiny square chunk of ocean inside the sim; and let the captain talk to him for a few hours. He approved it almost immediately after; and sent recommendations to the rest of the fleet to adapt the concept. In the event things worked out as planned, I would receive a commendation and, more importantly, greatly advance the future of human colonization. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nProject: Reality Sim, entry 2; 1 year. \\n\\nWith each new server I'm able to create a new simulation. I'm not going to hook them all together just yet; I'm letting each of them develop on their own in some form of isolation. The original simulation; Skull Island; I've slowed down so that when I finally sync all of them up, they'll be at the century mark. Right now, I'm only using a fraction of the capacity; once I have the whole system setup, I'll be able to simulate whole worlds, and tens of billions of people. Not time yet, though. We hit a bit of engine trouble, so the manufactory slowed down building the last servers. Final establishment won't be for another year.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nProject: Reality Sim, Entry 3; Year 2. \\n\\nI have twenty full server racks with millions of processors and drives running at the same time; all but one rack currently idle. When all is said and done I'll have the capacity to run five full solar sistems with twenty billion simulated people; If I let it get that big, I can't let the population get out of control. For right now, I'm being mostly hands-off. I'm manipulating things a bit so that everyone will be using the same language, but otherwise letting them develop naturally. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nProject: Reality Sim, Entry 4;\\n\\nThings have progressed remarkably. Running at ten times normal speed for the moment, and the seed settlements have expanded out into the world once the barriers came down; the final settlement never had barriers, the rest I manufactured some sort of arbitrary natural thing; hurricanes that took boats that sailed too far, deadly animals, impassible, invulnerable walls. All of which fell when the final connection was done. They've made iron and gunpowder, and the islanders built a steam engine! Things are looking incredible so far.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nProject: Reality Sim, Entry 5; \\n\\nWe're reaching the stage where the personalities might actually be useful for us in the future. The beginnings of space travel, with simulated spacecraft; all unmanned, so far. The religions here are all remarkably similar; and the wars never as bad as the real world. I suspect its less due to errors in simulation, and more due to starting everyone off on an even keel, with the same language. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nProject: Reality Sim, Entry 6;\\n\\nThe Captain had me slow the sim down and add some new features. Long story short, some of the colonists we make are going to have some amazing features; both cybernetic implants and incredible genetic gifts to help them survive hostile environments. He wants me to put some of the packages into the simulator as 'superpowers' to see how they might impact society; how people will live if they have powers far beyond their neighbors. I've seen some of what we're going to be able to do on landing; frankly this is going to be incredible.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nProject: Reality Sim, Entry 7;\\n\\nIts a disaster. At first, there were bands of caped heroes supporting the government and fighting the rare villain and ordinary crime. I especially loved how the colonial expedition was led be people who could survive in almost any temperature, a simulated parallel of our own real expedition. Any time one of these heroes passed, his personality was added to the bank of those that would be reborn in a new body on our colony. But when the Captain had me accelerate the timeline? Everything fell apart. Three key villains took over the world, and the only 'free' people were the colonists; and that only because -all- of the colonists were descendents of powered people. I've got to do something about this.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nProject: Reality Sim, Entry 8;\\n\\nIts getting worse. The society is diverging into two key layers on the primary world; the supervillain families and their slaves. I keep trying to shake things up; natural disasters that target the most evil segments. Making random powered people born into the slaves, fostering rebellion. I even directly intervened and caused heart attacks and other fatalities in a few key leaders. But nothing works. Only a tiny fraction of these personalities will be usable, mostly from the isolated colony. The captain is highly upset; the whole point of this was to give us millions of vibrant minds to feed into clone bodies for the initial colonization. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nProject: Reality Sim, Entry 9;\\n\\nI did it. I created an avatar with the powers of a god and directly walked in and intervened. I kept hooking myself in, then back out, accelerating time, and in again; crushing villains, destroying empires. Evil had grown so entrenched in them that I had to wipe out most of humanity. I even threw a global flood in, old testament style, by melting the ice caps, and only saved the small, relatively good sections of the world by using tectonic activity to push specific towns and regions higher in elevation. I knew what had caused the failure at this point; multiple generations of people with super-powers, growing more arrogant and corrupt with time. Honestly, this has significant impact on our future colony plans; we either need to give all of our colonists powers, or none of them. Otherwise, I see the exact same thing happening.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nProject: Reality Sim, Entry 10;\\n\\nThe captain disagreed; and that disagreement went up the chain to the Admiral as well; we'd have only a fifth or less as many colonists if we spent the time and energy using the exotic materials necesary to make -all- of them genetically superhuman, even ignoring the cost of the cybernetic implants necesary for some of the power packages. Our system was designed to produce large numbers of fairly normal, 100-200 pound humans; not an army of 500-pound superhumans who could survive gunfire and lift cars. I hated to do it, but I stopped interfering. The old colonists returned to earth, and at first were a noble, ruling class, helping fix everything. The captain was ecstatic; until I sped up the time scale. Two generations and it was back again; ruling dynasties of arrogant, corrupt evil. Only this time, the corruption spread to those once-isolated colonists. Fortunately, I'd saved the state of the simulation after the initial issue. All of our colonists will be superhuman in some way; and all of the people in the simulation, as well. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nProject: Reality Sim, Final Entry;\\n\\nI'm leaving the server running, as a sort-of afterlife for the minds still on it; only the most evil and unredeemable were fully deleted. The rest will either live on in digital form, or eventually find new bodies on the colony. Its strange to meet these people emerging from the cloning banks; they know exactly how and why they came to be, and view me with everything from reverence to hatred. For the moment, I've been asked to stay in orbit; they worry I might be a destabilizing influence on the colony, since most of the people there were once personalities I created. I doubt I'll be interfering with the sim again; now I'm doing my 'Real' job; building the millions of cloned bodies that will inhabit this place. My current body is growing old, fragile. I might be building one for myself soon. It should be interesting to truly have super-powers of my own.\",\n",

       " 'Ok, they finally sent me the folder with the actual code in it. I swear it took them ages for some reason.\\n\\nLet\\'s see how much bytes we are dealing with, I though as I clicked on the file\\'s properties, and that\\'s when my jaw dropped. \\n\\n1 GB.\\n\\nNow, don\\'t get me wrong, usually, one gigabyte isn\\'t that much, but that\\'s when you are talking about full blown software, with sounds and images. Just for text, which is what my client told me, that\\'s way too much. Maybe he included the game engine? I don\\'t even know if it\\'s a game.\\n\\nThe job was paid by the hour, and it is quite lucrative... So there\\'s no shame in trying. At most I\\'ll give up in an hour, I want to see how interesting is this code.\\n\\nOpening the folder, it has like 10 files and 10 folders in it, I was immediately attracted to a file called \"evenGen\", it seemed interesting enough to start with. As I skimmed through the code it seemed to depend largely on a person\\'s morality, but with a large degree of randomness. Is it a code for a simulation game? It has people in it, and morality at least. \\n\\nI kept reading more and more, and the code wasn\\'t really commented, so things were pretty hard to figure out, but it seemed to be extremely expansive, too expansive. I was hard-pressed to think of any game (I assumed it was a game, because software doesn\\'t usually have people and morality in it) .\\n\\nScrolling further down, I got to the \"fixed events\" section, in which I found out that the programmer also inserted holidays like Hanuka and Christmas into his code. Other holidays with funny names were listed but after a quick look in google, because of a nudging feeling, I found out they all really do exist. \\n\\nI felt a bit crazy, and it was late at night. I told myself I\\'d go to sleep, and I tried, but the result was that I was just lying in bed, thinking about my suspicion and wondering if it\\'s true. After a while, I have decided to get up and finish it, because if I am wrong, the code looks very complex, and making an ally of someone who\\'s capable of that much would be quite a nice thing.

My better life. I sighed sadly. I just wish I could go back. As I sat on my bed with tears in my eyes, I noticed the bright golden light peeking through my window and pulled back the blinds. The sun was rising. \\n\\nAt least the sun hadn\\'t changed. It was still beautiful, painting the sky with a bright crimsons and gorgeous yellows as the day began. I might as well make use of my form. So I threw open my window, stepping carefully onto the windowsill. I had climbed onto the roof  many times before, but it would be harder with the limitations of my new body. I reached for the nook that allowed me to grab the edge of the elevated parts before carefully pulling myself upwards with some strain.\\n\\nSidestepping the chimney, I walked forward until I was on the edge of the very top of my house\\'s roof. The morning sun cast its warm, radiant glow on my exhausted form.  That light gave me hope and energy bursting to be released.

It eventually spilled into the world in a chaotic wave, transforming us into previously mythological creatures. Everyone was changed, depending on their greatest attribute.\\n\\nThe greedy became either full dragons or dragonkin, such as half dragons, kobolds, even drakes and wyverns. The ones who were filled with disdain for their common men and women turned into vampires. The smart tinkerers became gnomes and dwarves. All manner of creatures came into existence, which brought about The Great Purge.\\n\\nIt was an unfortunate side effect. People strolling in the sun, who turned into vampires, burst into flames, with little warning. The mermen and merwomen died in cities, where they once walked with 2 legs, unable to breath air. Dragons pillaged their nearby areas, trolls and giants ate the smaller races. It was a terrible time.\\n\\nI was something incredibly different though. You see, most had fairly material attributes. The few that didnt fell underneath normal-ish titles. I didnt. It seemed to be my attribute was wanting to know about things beyond space time, and a lack of care for anything around me. Which yes, makes me sound like a bad person, to which you would mostly be right.\\n\\nI turned into a Cthulhi, a star apawn of Cthulhu itself. Time itself no longer held itself over me, for I became immortal. I was responsible for many peoples deaths, for when they saw my new form, their minds fractured, unable to comprehend me.\\n\\nI have been spending the time since then reading all knowledge that is available, as my mind now understands it all, and I can't forget anything.

They were a striking deep purple, and for a moment as I stared at them, I seemed to lose track of time. \\n\\nI fell to my knees. It felt like the room was closing in, and I gasped for breaths of air as my throat became tight. Sweat dripped off my face as I became suddenly aware of how hot and suffocating the office room was. I started to feel light-headed, and the lights in the room swirled as I collapsed onto the floor.\\n\\nI saw him crawl over me, his arms and legs bony and elongated. He unhinged his jaw to open his mouth fully, and finally I was able to see just how deformed his body had become. His mouth enveloped me whole, with its putrid warmth and wetness.\\n\\n*I told you to hide your fear. Why didn\\'t you listen?*',\n",
       " '\"Um... In the general sense? I think... yeah...\" I stammered. The sight before me was incredibly unnerving, but I hadn\\'t settled on fear until he\\'d leveled the question at me. I was doing my best to avoid it.\\n\\nHe acknowledged my answer with a quiet \"Hm.\" He had on a slight smile. You\\'d think his mouth wouldn\\'t be as terrifying while he kept it closed, but the too-wide lips created a constant anticipation that they were going to open into a horrible maw any second. And then they did.\\n\\n\"I think that a man needs to overcome his fears if he is to get ahead in life,\" he began. He had on an air of calm, and his tone suggested friendliness. \"You see...\" BUT THOSE TEETH. He\\'d been holding steady eye contact with me since I walked in, but I couldn\\'t tear my gaze away from the giant teeth that kept peeking out from behind his lips as he talked. They weren\\'t sharp, or fanged, or anything crazy like that. But they were huge! The whole situation was crazy.\\n\\nHe finished speaking. I snapped back to attention, trying to seem like everything was fine while my mind scrambled to recall what he\\'d said. No good. My eyes kept drifting back to his mouth. That awful anticipation again. I almost wished he\\'d start speaking again, just so I\\'d have something to distract me. I glanced around the room. He was still holding the apple core. Was that normal? Why would it be weird to hold on to it for that long? How long had it been? I could feel my breathing getting quicker.\\n\\nCalm down. I looked backed at his face. Was his smile wider than before? I tried not to think about it. He was still sitting calmly, apparently waiting for some kind of response. He must\\'ve asked me something? What was it? I missed something important. What did he say? No good. I couldn\\'t think of anything but that ridiculous mouth. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.\\n\\n\"Look sir,\" I said. \"I appreciate the opportunity you\\'ve given me to learn from your experience, but you caught me at a bad time.\" Good. Don\\'t sound unappreciative, but come up with something that will get me out of here. \"The thing is, I was in the middle of... uh...\" I trailed off. Come up with something, anything! \"Brushing my teeth!\" I blurted. Great. Of all the things I could\\'ve said. I decided to commit to it anyways. \"I just finished my lunch break.\" It was 4pm. \"I always make sure to brush my teeth afterwards. Cavities can get pretty uh... large... if you let them get out of control you know.\" Smooth. \"I\\'ll be much more ready for this meeting once that\\'s done I think.\"\\n\\nI stood up to leave, watching to see if he\\'d stop me. His expression didn\\'t change. He simply sat there with his friendly grin. \"Of course,\" he said. I\\'d been staring at his mouth again, and when it opened, I nearly jumped out of my skin. I threw myself backwards into the door with a loud BANG. I started fumbling with the handle. \"Sorry...\" I muttered. Calm down. I took a quick breath to steady my hands. I managed to turn the handle, and I turned around to say goodbye.\\n\\nHis friendly smile broke into a wide, toothy cheshire grin that almost seemed to separate the upper half of his head from his neck. I bolted from the room.',\n",
       " 'The careful walk to my boss’s office had been less than ideal, as I often tripped over my own feet in nervousness. So, when I saw my boss’s mouth being twice the normal size and as he ate his entire apple, I sat down looking at my feet to avoid staring. “Well of course, Mr. Byron, sir.” I respond nervously. “You see, my dear employee, there’s been a few too many...problematic accidents as of late in Department P,” He carefully stated. After seemingly taking about a minute looking through his filing cabinet before pulling a file out and laying it on the surface of his neatly organized desk but seemingly still dusty desk. The stench of rotten apples and dry erase markers lingered in the dusty air, he slid the dull, red file towards me, “And I was told you are good at problem solving.” “Problem solving?” I thought kinda perplexed, “I haven’t gotten a comment on that skill since early middle school!” I cough a bit into my elbow before looking back up at my boss, “Sir, if I may, I might not be the best at this assignment, Lena from down the hall is-“ “No. I have faith that you, Employee, will be able to get the job done just fine. Now go on ahead, you’ll meet a lady named  Margery, tell her I sent you! Hurry up now, no dilly dallying, you don’t have all day!” He nodded, smiling an oddly toothier grin as he ushered me out the cold, metal door and into the narrow hallway. Department P? Now, I didn’t really associate with that part of the company, our jobs were quite different. I’m in Department D, we handle paperwork and lawsuits. Currently, I am working on the lawsuit against the company stating that there have been people going missing inside the establishments. I carefully walked to the dingy old elevator that was probably around since before I was born. It took a while to get to the Department Room, but when I did, I knocked on their door. “Hello?” I carefully asked, “Hello? I was told to ask for a Miss...Margery?” I asked gently. A wildly colored eye peered out from the darkness of the Department Room. “Who sent ya’?” She asked in a craggily old voice. “The Boss sent me.” I responded simply, showing her my file. Her eye widened in apparent sympathy, “Ah, yes. A red file. Come in, dearie, come in. I have a lot to tell you with what little time you have left.”',\n",
       " 'Mr. Langley liked to have one on ones with his employees every few months, so being called into his office wasn\\'t anything abnormal. \"Sit down,\" ordered the skinny man sitting behind the desk. Cassi obeyed, taking a seat in one of the small office chairs on the opposite side. The sunlight gave the room a nice glow from the open curtains. She couldn\\'t help but notice that his mouth seemed larger than normal. *Did I fall asleep at my desk or something? That\\'s weird.*\\n\\nGesturing to the bowl of fruit on the corner of his desk, he asked, \"snack? I know *I\\'m* hungry. Almost lunch time.\" The unnaturally large smile spreading across the boss\\'s face was more than just a little creepy. She politely declined. Mr. Langley picked up one of the apples and spun it around for a moment, as if looking for a nice angle to bite into it from. Then he simply put the entire thing in his mouth, pulling the gnawed core out only a few seconds later. *Ok, Cassi. Usually you can\\'t see faces in your dreams. Could be some weird side effect of that new prescription? Please be a weird hallucination that didn\\'t actually just happen.*\\n\\n\"Do you feel fear?\" The question was just about as odd as her boss\\'s new mouth. \"Well, sometimes,\" she began, \"but it depends on what it is? Like heights. I hate heights.\" Cassi started fidgeting with her fingers. It was a habit when she was nervous. *I can feel my fingers. I\\'m not dreaming. Has to be the prescription.*\\n\\nMr. Langley chuckled. He pulled a folder out of a lower drawer on his desk, gently placing it in front of his employee. \"I\\'m doing a survey,\" he excitedly explained. The sudden enthusiasm was surprising. \"I just need you to fill this out for Halloween. We\\'re doing a haunted house this year! I want everyone to be,\" he paused, searching for the words, \"well, absolutely terrified. You can return to your desk when you\\'re done. I can see you\\'re getting antsy to jump back into it.\" He gave a small laugh before adding, \"or just getting to lunch. You really should try the apple pie Contessa brought in by the way. It\\'s to die for!\"\\n\\n\"A survey?\" Cassi eyed the folder for a moment before looking back at him. His mouth seemed normal sized again. *Thank. Fuck.* \"Halloween is, like,\" she paused to go over the months in her head, \"a full 2 months away. No one usually thinks about these things until the beginning of October.\" With a dismissive wave of the hand, Mr. Langley gave the excuse of Halloween being his favorite holiday. *Ok, that\\'s fine. I like Halloween too.*\\n\\nMr. Langley handed her a pencil. The folder contained a multiple choice questionnaire.\\nWhich is scarier: gore or spiders? Gore.\\nGore or mannequins? Mannequins.\\nSpiders or centipedes? Centipedes.\\nMannequins or centipedes? Centipedes.\\nNuns or devils? Devils.\\nDevils or centipedes? Centipedes. \\nDo you like apples? *What?*\\n\\nCassi stared at the paper for a moment. There were no more questions, just blank spots next to bubbles. *It was full of questions when I started wasn\\'t it?* She looked up, but there was no one behind the desk anymore. \"Mr. Langley? Where did you go?\" Her voice was hardly above a whisper. Getting out of the chair, Cassi made her way over to the window. Pulling aside one curtain, she saw the full moon shining down on the busy town below. Dumbfounded, Cassi stepped away, letting the curtain fall closed again. *It was sunny. I was only looking down for, like, five minutes. Tops.* \"Ok. I should-I should go home. Yes,\" she muttered to herself, thoroughly freaked out now. This was not ok. Why would he have just left her in his office asleep all night? She quickly exited the room.\\n\\nAll the lights were on in the building. There was an eerie silence hanging in the air of the usually busy place that lead to an overwhelming sense of paranoia. Cassi quietly made her way back towards her cubicle, jumping at every little creak and groan. It felt as though her clicking heels could wake the dead. She passed Contessa\\'s cubicle and peeked inside. Contessa kept a little rubby ducky on her desk that Cassi just couldn\\'t resist squeaking when she went by. The tiny squeak broke the quiet just enough. Cassi smiled and continued on.\\n\\nAfter returning to her cubicle, Cassi packed up her things. The clock on her computer\\'s start bar said it was around 10pm. It was definitely her bed time. Turning to exit the cubicle, she stepped on something. \"Who left that there? I know we have janitors, but come on.\" She picked up the piece of paper, turning it over to look at the odd symbol drawn on it. It was colored with yellow highlighter. \"Oh, yeah. Jack was drawing this earlier.\" With a shurg, she slung the backpack on and made her way towards the building\\'s exit.\\n\\nPassing Contessa\\'s cubicle once more, a sweet, warm smell smell stopped her. There was a full pie on the desk. It looked like someone had just taken it out of the oven moments ago. \"That wasn\\'t there,\" said Cassi, \"Boss mentioned it though. Fuck. Maybe I\\'ve finally just lost it.\" The pie smelled amazing. Temptation and the fact that she never got to eat lunch nagged at her. *Tessie wouldn\\'t mind. It probably tastes amazing.* She shook her head, \"no. I should go home, call off sick tomorrow, and call my doctor.\" The woman struggled to physically pull herself away, but continued to the elevator, sad and hungry without pie.\\n\\nThe light for the ground floor clicked on, the door opened, and Cassi walked into the lobby. \"You know, for as weird as today was, at least it can\\'t get any worse probably.\" She looked down at the drawing in her hand. \"This gives me a great idea for a story though.\"',\n",
       " 'The afternoon sun trickled through the window blinds, sectioning Esteban’s grim expression in amber light, “Do you feel fear, Joel?”\\n\\nJoel sat in front of Esteban, separated by a formidable dark mahogany desk, it was littered with documents and folders, with a fruit bowl on one end. His eyes fixated on Esteban’s mouth, the words appeared numb and distant to him, was he having a stroke? The mouth seemed to have doubled in size since his last visit. “Of course,” he wagered, “it’s human nature”\\n\\n“Human,” Esteban repeated, he picked up an apple from the fruit bowl and shoved it into the growing slit on his face, he crushed its entirety in a loud crunch.\\n\\nJoel’s neck hair started to rise, he was feeling sick and wanted to run out of the office, either he was having an episode or his boss was turning into something unspeakable, “Is everything alright, sir?” he said.\\n\\nA grin reaching from ear to ear seemed to slam into Joel like a breaking wave, “Never felt better, you look a little pale, however. Am I unsettling you in some way?” Esteban said, his voice no longer the one Joel remembered.\\n\\nJoel wanted to jump up and yell, “What’s wrong with your face!”, but he stifled the thought and instead said, “No sir, I must be feeling unwell, what did you want? Why am I here?”\\n\\nEsteban nodded, his shoulders visibly shifting and snapping into grotesque angles, though it didn’t seem to bother him. After a short pause he said, “I need you to do something for me, something that’s not strictly, how should I put this, *legal*.”\\n\\nJoel watched in horror as chunks of hair fell off Esteban’s now expanding head, he closed his eyes. “What,” he stammered, “do you need?”  \\n\\nEsteban said, “Tony Parker has been running his mouth, mentioning things about me that he shouldn’t, things he couldn’t possibly understand. I need you to, let’s say, permanently persuade him to shut up, before anyone decides to listen to him.”\\n\\nJoel said, his eyes still closed, “No, Esteban, listen. Please, I can’t, can’t be asked to do this, there must be someone else that’s better suited!”\\n\\nJoel heard the footsteps of Esteban approaching him, could feel the electricity of him growing closer, a vile torrent of breath flowed past him, smelling like rotten seaweed. “You will do it,” Esteban said in a low voice. Joel dared not open his eyes.\\n\\nTerror gripped Joel, he needed to get out of this room, out of this city, he needed to run until his feet blistered with sores and his body collapsed from exertion, he needed to put the maximal distance between him and this thing as possible. He answered with what he thought Esteban wanted to hear, he said, involuntarily repeating some of his words, “Yes, no you’re right, I’ll see to it.”\\n\\nThe floor creaked and Esteban’s voice boomed from above, “Good, that’s very good, Joel! I knew you were my man. Return to me once it’s done.”\\n\\nJoel got up on his feet with some effort and began to carefully open his eyes. A second later he passed out.',\n",
       " '\"Do you feel fear?\" My new boss asks, his mouth flexes weirdly as he chews, spewing apple at me.\\n\"Of course I feel fear Dr. Stein. Every creature has a fear response.\" I smile, trying my best not to sweat in the heat of the room, or at the bizarre patchwork man addressing me.\\n\"Then how,\" he gestures to the offices beyond his, \"do you expect to manage to do this job, working with unnaturals like us?\"\\n\"Well doctor I must say things that go bump in the night are nothing new to me. In fact I got myself blacklisted by Fear corp, apparently making the monster under the bed join a dolly tea party is a cruel breach of contract.\"\\n\"Impressive, this was not on your resume.\"\\n\"I didn\\'t think it had to be, I try not to advertise my deviance.\" I shrug, \"besides, my other credentials speak for themselves.\"\\n\"True, true. But with such impressive legal qualifications you could have work anywhere. Selected your own price tag even. Yet you choose to work here.\" He raises an eyebrow. \"At a diminutive company created by unnaturals for unnaturals? What ever could cause a human to work here?\"\\n\"My mother taught me everyone needs someone in their corner, they can\\'t always fight for themselves. Correct representation of minorities within humanity itself is hard enough. This firm is infamous. Stein and Belmont is the single largest non human legal entity on the planet.\"\\n\"We\\'re not even in the phone books.\" His eyes narrow\\n\"Neither am I. Though to be fair the yellow pages doesn\\'t exactly see much print nowadays.\" I give a light laugh, trying to diffuse the tense air that forming.\\n\"A great shame. I\\'m sure a great many people would want to find you.\"\\n\"That is exactly why I\\'m not in them. Now Dr. Stein, if everything is to your liking I believe your partner Mr Belmont wishes to brief me on the company\\'s policies on accepting payment. I worry he may think I take after my mother.\"\\n\"Why ever would he think that mr. Caelligh?\" I grin at his slight confusion as I stand up to leave.\\n\"My mother prefers to say I\\'m adopted. Its nicer than saying I was payment.\"\\n\"Firstborn are we?\"\\n\"Yes sir.\"\\n\"Well then. Provided you don\\'t enact the law of suprise mr Belmont will have nothing to worry about. Welcome aboard mr Caelligh. We\\'re happy to have you.\"',\n",
       " '“Do you feel fear?” \\n\\nDid I? Maybe there was a bit of fear left inside me, but at this point I didn’t feel anything at all. At night, strange noises and shapes at the corner of my eye had kept me awake, and the nightmares tortured me as I slept. Lately I hadn’t been eating or sleeping. The line between fiction and reality became blurrier and blurrier. It was all I could do to go to work that day. And worst of all, my cat had gone missing.\\n\\nAt first I was worried about my cat. It wasn’t like him to run away. And who would want to kidnap him? He’d just sit there begging for lasagna and making snarky comments until they grew tired and sent him back. But as the days went by, my dreams became worse and worse.\\n\\nAnd now I was called to my bosses’ office, presumably because I hadn’t gotten any progress on my comics in weeks. But something was definitely wrong. Why was his mouth so *big?* I answered him the best I could.\\n\\n“No sir,” I said, a bit of a lie.\\n\\n“Well you should be, Jon.” That was strange, he didn’t usually call me by my first name.\\n“Don’t you recognize me? Didn’t you miss me?” His mouth opened until it covered his entire head. Inside of my bosses mouth, I saw a familiar face.\\n\\n“GARFIELD?!?” I exclaimed. But this was no longer the cat I once knew. He had fangs protruding from his mouth and beady eyes staring into my soul. He wore my boss like a onesie, and began to tear him off.\\n\\nSuddenly, he was my normal boss again, even with the normal mouth. \\n\\n“Are you OK? I’m very worried about you,” he said. You look terrible. Do you need some time off?” He couldn’t fool me. I shoved him away and took off as fast as I could down the hallway.\\n\\n“YOU CAN’T ESCAPE ME, JON,” he bellowed after me as I fled. I ran outside and all the way back to my house, exhausted. I locked the doors and turned around.\\n\\nNormal-looking Garfield stood one front of me with a bottle of pills and some lasagna. \\n\\n“I made some for you this time,” he said. “You need to rest, and please take your pills. You haven’t taken them in a while.” Then he turned into his larger, grotesque form. “Awww, poor Jon,” he mocked. He threw the pills at my forehead, causing me to stumble.\\n\\nI ran to the garage as he chased me. I grabbed a baseball bat and turned around to face him. He was in his normal form again. I began to beat him to death.\\n\\n“STOP JON, PLEASE!” He begged. “IT’S ME, GARFIELD! YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR PILLS!” He fled outside as I chased him. \\n\\n“SOMEONE HELP!” He screamed “PLEA-“ I had won. His mangled, bloody corpse was strewn about my yard. My neighbors looked very concerned, so I waved to them, letting them know I was all right.\\n\\nA few minutes later, the police showed up to my house. I decided to play it safe and say I had no idea what happened to him, and I acted horrified. They were about to leave when I heard a voice.\\n\\n“You really thought that was all it would take, Jon?” It came from inside one of the cops. I began to attack them, knowing he was inside one of them. One pulled out a taser, and everything went black.\\n\\nWhen I woke up, I was in a hospital. Liz sat beside me, looking concerned.\\n\\n“Finally, you’re awake!” She exclaimed. “I’ve heard awful things, and I’m not sure what to believe. But you can tell me after you take your pills. The doctor told me to give you these.” She held out her palm, holding a few pills. Finally, someone I could trust. She would understand. But I had to tell her before I did anything else.\\n\\nI told her about what had happened. As a continued, she grew increasingly concerned. At the end she began to cry. I wasn’t sure if she felt bad for me, or if she thought I was crazy.\\n\\n“Don’t worry Jon, I understand,” said a voice I knew too well. Garfield peeled off her face, revealing his blood stained fur underneath. “Oh, you weren’t going to tell on me, were you? You’d never do that.” I leaped from my bed and started strangling him. She returned to normal, but I wasn’t fooled. She screamed and cried but I held my grip. Then she slumped to the floor, dead. \\n\\nThe hospital staff ran inside, horrified at the scene they saw. They ran off and left me there with the corpse.\\n\\nI sat down and began to cry. My boss was dead. Garfield was dead. Liz was dead. Garfield killed them, but it felt like it was me as well. I wept until the police came in.\\n\\n“HANDS UP!” An officer exclaimed. “GET ON THE GROUND!” I complied and stooped down. But as he grew near, fooled into security, I quickly grabbed his gun from his pocket and shot him twice in the chest.\\n\\n*BANG! BANG!*\\n\\nHe fell down dead. I aimed the gun at the officers, but it was too late. The last thing I saw was their guns pointed at me, and the empty face of Liz. \\n\\n*What have I done?*',\n",

I fell- too shocked to scream- for a few seconds before my car connected with the ground. I remembered the feeling of my neck whipping around- I had no control- then the sharp pain...then, nothing.\\n\\nI awoke in a hospital bed, surrounded by too many faces. Some were familiar- my mother, my girlfriend- some were not. A Doctor? And a...demon?\\n\\nI must\\'ve been hallucinating that part.\\n\\nI waited, allowing the overwhelming sensations to wash over me, processing everything in due time.\\n\\nShortly, I realized that, try as I might, I could not move anything. Not my toes, nor my fingers- not even my lips. The only thing I was able to move were my eyes.\\n\\nI felt like crying- I felt like I had broken into a million pieces and I could never be put back together. I felt... something beyond words. My future was taken from me. My passions in life, my goals, everything I had already worked to achieve- all of it was gone. My girlfriend was likely going to be gone, too, after a time- and my mother, burdened with taking care of me.\\n\\nTears were flowing, but I was unable to sob or hold my head in my hands.\\n\\nAbout an hour later, the Doctor realized that I wasn\\'t merely comatose; I was entirely paralyzed.\\n\\nThey pulled my mother into the hallway to explain it to her- they thought I couldn\\'t hear. It was the Doctor and...that demon again. They explained my mom\\'s options. They explained that medical science had made several recent breakthroughs- perhaps in ten years, I could regain some mobility. They also explained that compassionate euthanasia was an option, if I agreed to it. A \\'blink twice if you wanna die\\' situation.\\n\\nFor a moment, I felt like laughing. Entirely inappropriate- and I couldn\\'t, even though I wanted to- but the feeling was there. Until my mother finally gave in and started to sob- long, broken sobs, interrupted only by the beeping of my heart monitor and the noise of passing nurses.\\n\\nI tried to stay awake, so I could have...some semblance of a conversation with my mother- but sleep took me, aided by what I assumed to be a lot of drugs.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI awoke- the sun was shining. A package was on the end of my bed- I could see a small bit of handwriting on the tag- Emilie- my girlfriend\\'s- handwriting.\\n\\nI reached out to grab it, only to be thwarted by the... slightly significant wound I bore. Unable to move, or even to growl my frustration, I seethed internally.\\n\\nTen years, they wagered, before I would be back on my feet?\\n\\nI wasn\\'t sure I could wait that long.\\n\\nMom entered the room, having just gone to lunch- I could tell by the smell clinging to her. Tomato soup, if I had guessed correctly.\\n\\n\\nShe wasn\\'t alone- one of the demons was following her.\\n\\nMaybe I shouldn\\'t be mentally labeling them as demons- maybe they were *benevolent* red-skinned, horned people. \\n\\nMom sat next to me, the \\'horned one\\' merely hovered behind her. It was dressed very nondescript- plain blue jeans and a dark shirt. Mom was completely unaware of its presence.\\n\\n\"Hey, buddy.\" She said, gently laying her hand on my shoulder. I rolled my eyes back. \"Oh, right, you can\\'t feel it.\" She chuckled a little. I tried to say I thought it was funny, too, using my eyes...not sure if she got that. \"Good to see you\\'re in there. Now- I know you. You\\'re not one to wallow in self-pity- and, well- I don\\'t want to say too much and give you false hope, but there\\'s this new...um, savant, I guess? He\\'s been working on a technology that interfaces with nerves. His tech is going through human trials now- well. What I\\'m trying to say is, there are options. I don\\'t think you\\'ll really be bed-ridden forever.\" Her tone was bright and optimistic- powerful, even.\\n\\nThen the horned one reached over and touched her shoulder. \"I wish...your father had been here. He would know what to do, what to say. I\\'m sorry, I probably sound...so silly, talking about the future. You should-\"\\n\\nShe kept talking, but I had stopped listening. I knew exactly what had happened- this *demon* was screwing with *my mom*, and *NOW* of all times?!\\n\\nI summoned all the mental energy I had, cutting through the fog caused by the meds- and I reached out and grabbed this demon by the throat.\\n\\nHonestly, I hadn\\'t expected anything to happen. My body was still non responsive- but some sort of *energy* responded to my call, and the demon, with eyes wide, began to choke under my pressure.\\n\\nIt only took a moment before the demon got the message- and disappeared.\\n\\n\"Sorry, Matthieu. I was- I\\'m rambling. Give me a moment, my head just isn\\'t on quite right. Sorry you had to see this.\" Mom stepped outside to collect herself.\\n\\nGods, I wish I could\\'ve stepped outside to collect myself. What the hell had just happened?\\n\\nSuddenly, a new voice popped into my head. *Ah, a psychic. Shame it took you paralysis to realize your gift- but these things happen! I am Daruna, welcome to...well. Welcome to whatever this is!* His rich voice laughed, and my mind was filled with visions of people- some past, some present- perhaps a few in the future?\\n\\nThey were rejoicing together- feasting, singing- some were battling, chasing down the demons and forcing them out- others still were healers, going to the wounded of the world and touching them in ways modern medicine could not reach.\\n\\n*We have MUCH to discuss.*',\n",

       " 'This is New Orleans: it’s all haunted, so it’s just a question of what type of haunting you can afford. I rent the hump of a camelback that comes with my sweet old landlady Mrs. Boudreaux on the ground floor, and Marcel, a rascally and noisy apparition just on the right side of the line between playful and malevolent. Sure, anyone would prefer a gentle gray lady or, even better, a faithful hound-spirit, but only Marcel is in my price-range. \\n\\nHe speaks only old-timey French, so I really only know what Mrs. Boudreaux has told me: he died after a wound he sustained in a duel festered, and apparently carried on in afterlife due to his honor never being satisfied. Mostly, Marcel tuts and harrumphs at me only when I’m eating takeout in my underwear, or doing something else slothful, so I was pretty surprised to see him over Gisele’s shoulder in my kitchenette. \\n\\nGisele. She’s from Miami. Do they have ghosts in Miami? Probably not wherever Gisele lived, because when she said she wanted to cook for me and I said “okay, but my place is haunted,” she just laughed like I told a joke. She just started her master’s at Tulane, I guess she can afford tuition *and* a place with only a mild haunting. \\n\\nSo: one third-date, at my place, with a girl who doesn’t believe in ghosts and a ghost who doesn’t approve of girls, judging by the look on his ethereal face. \\n\\nShe’s busy chopping onions, so she doesn’t see Marcel swoop close and knock off my hat. I decide not to draw Gisele’s attention to Marcel and get up from the couch to block Gisele’s view. \\n\\n“Oh, you want to help?” she asks, completely misinterpreting my movement.\\n\\n“Uh...yeah.” What else is there to say? \\n\\nI shoot Marcel a *look* and he smiles at me, that scamp. \\n\\nWe chop vegetables together, and Gisele tells me about her class on the evolution of the English language. The vegetables and a rump roast go in a pot—that Gisele brought—and the pot goes in the oven—that Gisele had to show me how to turn on. \\n\\nI open my cabinet and pick out a bottle of Riesling. Marcel appears at my elbow and cuffs my head. \\n\\n“Ow!” \\n\\n“What’s that?” Gisele asks, settling into my couch. \\n\\n“Nothing,” I say, rubbing my head and glaring at Marcel. I rest my hand on another white, and Marcel shakes his head. Cabernet? Marcel nods, and I open it. \\n\\n“Perfect pairing,” Gisele compliments me. Marcel smiles smugly in the corner of my eye. Is he... trying to help me? \\n\\nHe must be, because now he’s standing by my bookcase, wiggling one of the books as Gisele checks on the food. The John Adams biography? I give Marcel the eye, but get up and remove it from the shelf anyway. Marcel blows on the pages to the middle. \\n\\n“Uh...” I bring it to her. \\n\\n“Yes!” she says, “this is exactly what we’re talking about in class, the transition to standardized spelling, totally on display in the letters between John and Abigail.”\\n\\nI glance at the page. The letter starts “Miss Adorable.” \\n\\nMarcel mimes clearing his throat, so I take a chance and begin to read aloud. \\n\\n——\\n\\n“She was totally, totally charmed,” I tell Mrs. Boudreaux the next day. “Thanks, Marcel.” \\n\\nMrs. Boudreaux smiles. \\n\\n“I feel bad for the poor ghost, all those moves and no one to use them on.”\\n\\nShe arches an eyebrow. \\n\\n“Is that what you think, *ami*?” \\n\\nFrom over her shoulder, I hear a wry Francophone cackle.',\n",

       " '\"Hey handsome,\" Madison walked into the kitchen to her husband sitting quietly at the table. \"There\\'s something I want to talk to you about,\" she said as she kissed his tan, furrowed brow. \"You okay? It looks like you\\'ve got something on your mind too,\" she sat down next to him.\\n\\n\"Yeah, I do,\" he said. David kept his gaze locked on his hands resting on the table; he didn\\'t look up to meet her eyes.\\n\\n\"What is it, honey?\" Madison reached across the table to take his hand. He didn\\'t move his away, but he didn\\'t make an effort to entangle his hand in hers. He remained still and limp; when he spoke his voice was monotone and difficult to gauge.\\n\\n\"We tell each other everything, right?\" David asked; still refusing to look up. \"You wouldn\\'t lie to me about anything?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I wouldn\\'t!\" Madison nodded eagerly as an uncomfortable knot formed in her belly. She didn\\'t know what was on his mind, but at that moment he felt more distant than ever in their short, passionate relationship. They hadn\\'t even been married for two years yet, but every moment had been perfect for her. If he was about to tell her he was leaving, she wasn\\'t sure she could handle that. Right now of all times.\\n\\n\"I found something... *strange* in the laundry today,\" David replied with a steady voice. For the first time since their meeting, Madison couldn\\'t read him. That worried her.\\n\\n\"In the laundry?\" Madison asked; she tilted her head quizzically. \"What is it?\\' she asked. She briefly wondered if she\\'d lost track of a scale, but dismissed the thought. She didn\\'t think that would warrant the coldness he was giving off.\\n\\n\"Before I show you, you have to promise to tell me the truth,\" he said. For the first time since she walked in he looked up and stared straight into her eyes. \"No matter how much you think it might hurt right now; trying to lie or cover anything up will make it worse. Do you promise?\" he asked with a stern glare.\\n\\n\"Of course!\" Madison nearly rolled her eyes, but it seemed important to him that she give her word. She squeezed his hand. \"I promise, love. No matter what, I\\'m always honest with you.\" David nodded to himself.\\n\\n\"Okay. So, tell me...,\" David moved his hands from the table and revealed a large, palm-sized iridescent fish scale. \"Who does this belong to?\" he asked. \"I know it belongs to a male, your scales are smaller.\"\\n\\nMadison was confused when she first saw the scale. Her life was threatening to fall apart, and her stressed, blanked out mind struggled to explain the mystery scale. Luckily, when David pointed out it belonged to male she suddenly had her answer. That answer consisted of a heavy, obnoxious, belly laugh. She guffawed for a moment, before she managed to calm down.\\n\\n\"It\\'s my dad\\'s!\" she answered, still giggling. \"My parents came around for brunch today, and my dad wanted to try out the pond; he didn\\'t bother to take his clothes off until after he was in the water.\\n\\n\"Your parents came by?\" David asked. He vaguely remembered seeing her dad\\'s scales at their ocean-side wedding. His faded memory matched the colorful scale in his hand. As much as he believed her, he thought he got along well with his in-laws. It stung a bit to know they visited while he was at work. \"Why not when I was home?\" he asked. Madison squeezed David\\'s hand again. This time, he squeezed back.\\n\\n\"I needed some advice; and that\\'s what I wanted to talk to you about,\" she said. Madison looked him in the eyes and smiled.\\n\\n\"I\\'m pregnant!\" she said.\\n\\n\"No way...,\" David immediately jumped up and pulled Madison to her feet to wrap his arms around her. \"THAT\\'S GREAT!!\"\\n\\n\"It is..,\" Madison sighed on his shoulder. \"I wanted to ask my parents if they knew any human/mermaid couples that had children. They said not to worry about a thing, it happens all the time.\" She squeezed David, and he squeezed her back.\\n\\n \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nThank you for reading! I’m responding to prompts every day.

       " 'I picked up the fish scale and held it up to the light.  Perhaps its beauty mesmerized me, because I felt a lot calmer than I thought I would be in such a situation. It\\'s not that I expected to find something so bizarre in my wife\\'s laundry, but my time at sea had taught me that things are not always as they seem. As I turned the scale over in my hands, it seemed to get warm and stretchy. I dropped it back into the laundry pile and let out a small yelp. My wife heard.\\n\\n\"Henry? Are you alright\"? she asked. It sounded like she was in the garden.\\n\\n\"Ah, honey, could you come in here for a sec? I was just taking out the laundry and I noticed something kinda weird\" I said. I heard the rush of her footsteps.\\n\\n\"Is everything alright?\" she said, standing in the doorway. Her bushy brown hair was even more disheveled than usual. Her eyes, blue like a calm day at sea, were fraught with worry. \\n\\nI carefully picked the fish scale up with my thumb and pointer finger and held it up for her to see. \"I found this in your laundry. Any idea what it is?\" I asked.\\n\\nShe gently took it from my hand. \"Oh\" she said softly. Her face looked blank.\\n\\n\"Jen, you\\'re not going to tell me you\\'re part fish, are you?\" I joked, looking at her hoping to see a smile. But quite to the contrary, there were tears streaming down her face.\\n\\n\"I\\'m so sorry\" she cried, \"I should have told you earlier!\"\\n\\n\"That you\\'re part fish? How come I\\'ve never noticed anything like this before?\" Being married, I had seen and felt pretty much all over her body, and as far as I knew, she was all woman.\\n\\n\"No, no, that\\'s not what I meant\" Jen said, shaking her bushy locks back and forth. \"I\\'m a siren.\"\\n\\n\"You can\\'t be serious. Are you?\" I said.\\n\\n\"I am\" she said. She sighed deeply. \"We\\'re not the murderers you think we are\" she added, after seeing me get up with my fists clenched.\\n\\n\"Oh?\" I replied. \"Then I guess I just imagined the way my shipmates were lured to their deaths by you singing harpies\". \\n\\n\"Henry, I\\'m really sorry you lost your crew. It was a terrible day for all of us\". If she said anything else after that, I didn\\'t hear it. Blood was roaring in my ears.\\n\\n\"Wait, you were there?!\" I yelled. I suddenly lunged forward and caught her by the arm as she recoiled. \"How many of my shipmates did you kill?\" \\n\\n\"Let go of me!!!\" she squealed, trying unsuccessfully to twist out of my grip.\\n\\n\"No\" I said. \"Tell me\". \\n\\n\"All of them! None of them! I don\\'t know!\" she cried.\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" I let go of her and let her regain her composure.\\n\\n\"Sirens aren\\'t born. they\\'re made\" she said. \"A long time ago, my family and I were shipwrecked on the same island you and your crew were. A sea monster ate everyone except for me. It gave me this scale and told me I could either become a siren and lure prey for it, or it would eat me. So I accepted the scale and joined the other sirens on the island. We were kept chained up so we couldn\\'t escape. But after watching your ship crash on the rocks, and the men scream for help as they were eaten by the sea monster, I realized that I had to escape. So when the monster wasn\\'t looking, I would constantly file away at the chain with my scale, and put it back on when the monster surfaced to inspect us. Finally I broke free and I swam in the same direction I had seen you and the other survivors heading in a lifeboat. Eventually I reached the mainland and was able to find you, and well, the rest is history\".\\n\\nI must have looked skeptical, because after a moment she said \"What, you don\\'t believe me? Here, watch me transform\". She pressed the scale to her waist and it stretched the way it had when I held it, only this time it multiplied into thousands of more scales which covered her entire waist and formed a magnificent fish tail. \"See?\" she said, allowing the scales to retract back into the original and handing it back to me as though it were a token of peace.\\n\\n\"No, I believe you\" I said, feeling the scale heat up again and become malleable in my hands. I tossed it back to her. My mind was still busy processing everything Jen had just told me, and an idea was beginning to take hold \"Do you think if you went back, you\\'d be able to get the sea monster to come to the surface?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Probably\" she said. \"But I would never do that, because I would get eaten the second it saw me.\"\\n\\n\"Not if I\\'m here to protect you\" I said. \"It\\'s about time I got revenge for my crew. Let\\'s head to the port.\" I hadn\\'t set sail in years, but now I felt as if I had never set foot off ship.\\n\\n\"Right now? Well, if you insist...\" she said, sliding her scale into her pocket while I rummaged around in the closet.\\n\\nI shouldered the largest harpoon gun I had and slung a bag of gunpowder over the other shoulder. In my hands I carried a bundle of harpoons. \"As a matter of fact I do insist. Why don\\'t we just treat this like a second honeymoon?\"\\n\\nMy wife reluctantly agreed. I could tell she was only agreeing to go because of how important this was to me. Well, no matter. I would be sure to make up for it on the way there and when we got back. We stepped out the door and began the voyage to our destiny.',\n",

Hit me with the same line she did then,\\n\\n\"you know they were even more useless in person, right?\" She giggled out. \\n\\nI reached into my pocket and pulled the ring. I dropped to one knee and proposed. She was a little stunned at first, she couldn\\'t take her eyes off of the ring. It was a little awkward how long she held that pause... Then she snapped back into it and said yes. She practically burst with excitement when I put the ring on her finger. We went out for drinks that night, to celebrate. \\n\\nIt was a wonderful occasion after all. We hit the bar. After we had our drinks, I was more than a little tipsy, but she seemed perfectly fine. She always could hold her liquor. She half carried me over to a drink machine to buy me some coffee\\n\\n\"Oh no, I\\'m not letting you pass out tonight. I\\'m not finished with you yet!\" I\\'m sure it was very seductive, but I was trying desperately to keep my legs from buckling, despite the fact she had placed me on a bench. \\n\\n\"Aw, shoot. I only have my card, sweetie, do you have any cash on you? I\\'m gunna get you a coffee. Pay you back later, I promise\" the last part she whispered in my ear, sultry as you like. \\n\\nYeahsur, howmch u nd\" I managed to stumble out. \\n\\n\"About tree fiddy\" she said. \\n\\nAnd that was when I realised my fianceè was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Let me tell you what, that will sober you up real quick. \\n\\nSo I said \"Got Dang loch mess monster, of course you can have my tree fiddy\".',\n",

       " ' In a world darkened by the shadow of peril, love still found a way to blossom.\\n\\nJim smiled to himself as he unlocked the door with his spare key. It still felt like only yesterday they had swapped keys. With them safely returned to his pocket, he picked up the grocery bags and entered. A bump of his hip nudged the door closed behind him and cut off the view of the silent, watchful eyes outside.\\n\\n\\xa0In practice, exchanging keys was a very minor thing; but with regards to their relationship, it announced their arrival at the next stage. Or at least, that is what it felt like to Jim. It was the first time that Jim had ever given that much trust to anyone outside his direct family. But not even every member of his family was so trusted. And in such cases, keys were merely temporarily loaned. Jim honestly didn\\'t want his family to feel welcome to come over any time they wanted.\\n\\nBut things were different with Elise.\\n\\nThey had met at the local book store. It was an ancient building with towering shelves. The place was a maze of reading nooks. Jim had often retreated to that labyrinth to lose himself for hours. He had been surprised when the clear-eyed woman bumped into him on a narrow aisle. They shared a laugh and the next thing he knew, they were talking.\\n\\nElise was new to the area and Jim was surprisingly outgoing and casual when she asked him for directions to the fantasy section. She was mourning the loss of her private book collection. Her prior apartment had caught fire and everything was lost. She\\'d taken it as a sign and packed up what little she had left for a fresh start.\\n\\nThe normally reticent and shy Jim didn\\'t accomplish much reading that day. He\\'d done a great deal less reading in the 10 months since. Like Jim, Elise wasn\\'t terribly close with her family. They lived comfortably far away that she could go visit, but not so close that it was convenient. She had actually been off visiting her family for the last two weeks and she was due to return that night. Jim\\'s arrival was in anticipation of that. After two weeks, all of her fresh food was sure to have spoiled.\\n\\nThe thin plastic bags strained under the weight of fresh groceries. Small eyes watched him walk through the living room to the kitchen. He more so felt, than saw the bag with the heavy gallon of milk start to give way. A rushed final step failed to deliver the groceries to the counter before the sack split and dumped the heavy gallon down onto the floor. Jim groaned as the heavy plastic split with a splash and the milk suddenly rushed out into the large, thick decorative carpet that stretched across the hardwood floor.\\n\\nJim wasn\\'t sure how much the carpet had cost, but he was very aware that the milk would sour and reek and the hard wood would be damaged by extended exposure to moisture. Within minutes he had every towel available pressed into the carpet in an effort to soak up the milk. Once the majority of the milk had been soaked up and wrung out in the sink, the dining table and chairs were pulled into the kitchen. Unencumbered by the furniture, Jim began to roll up the wide carpet that stretched over the center of the dining area. The carpet was surprisingly stiff and heavy, but more surprising was what the rolled up carpet had been concealing.\\n\\nBeneath the rolled up carpet lay a door in the floor. A ring of stone encircled the doorway with old, strange runes carved along the perimeter. The coarse grain of the wood was slightly charred, as if it had barely avoided a bonfire. A large bronze ring was set into the door as a handle. Jim found it strange that he had never noticed the door beneath the carpet. He should have noticed the raised stone edge or the thick ring. Curious, he tested the pull on the door and found that it opened easily. Rough-cut wooden stairs led into the darkness below and a cool, moist breeze wafted up. Strangely, it smelled of the sea.\\n\\nThis might not have been an issue in Florida or California or any oceanside state. It was extremely out of the ordinary, however, for Topeka, Kansas.\\n\\nJim was curious, but also concerned. Elise had been out of town for two weeks. It was possible her water heater had sprung a leak. He felt torn. He did not want to go poking around every corner of her house. It was just the sort of thing he was certain his sister would do if she had free run of his place. But if there was any sort of damage that he could mitigate by acting early, he did want to help. He retrieved a small LED Flashlight from the Junk drawer and stepped down into the darkness.\\n\\nThe walls that he had originally thought were cinder blocked proved to be solid stone on closer inspection. The stairs down led much farther than he expected and six steps down a crashing thud announced with stunning finality that the door above had closed. He went back up the stairs and tested the door but it would not budge, no matter how hard he pressed on it. For long minutes, Jim pounded on the door but there was no answer. He figured it must have somehow jammed when it fell shut.\\n\\nThe breeze swirled around him once more as he turned to face the darkness. The breeze was tempting. If there was enough of an opening to let in a draft, then surely there must be another way out of the basement. With this goal in mind he stepped back down the stairs with just the tiny LED to light his way.\\n\\nThe stairs ended after a short flight, but the ceiling rose so high above that the LED light couldn\\'t illuminate it. With only the stairs behind as a landmark Jim decided to follow the breeze. He turned his face full into it\\'s flow and the smell of ocean spray only increased. He carefully walked across the immense underground cavern towards the source of the breeze. The cool air lead to a tunnel and as he began to follow it, he heard a low, dull roar growing around him. A sudden turn in the tunnel revealed the source finally.\\n\\nAn immense \\xa0window in the cave wall opened up on a moon-lit expanse of star-studded sky. The shock of it being night outside was immediately dwarfed by fact that there were two moons, one with a decidedly-blue pallor. Further, the window appeared to be set into a cliff face with a drop of several hundred feet ending in ocean surf, rising and falling against the stone. In the distance a range of mountains rose proudly from the ocean waters. One of the peaks smoked lazily, the underside of the cloud lit a golden-orange cast from below.\\n\\nHe gaped at the sight for several long minutes, dumbfounded, before a new sound caught his attention: footsteps, approaching from behind. He turned to the dark, all the more imposing with his eyes accustomed to the moonlit exterior. The LED did next to nothing to illuminate the approach.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s there? Come on... Come out.\"\\n\\nThe foot-steps paused and then resumed at a slower pace. He saw a figure come around the corner and was relieved to see Elise. Dirty and exhausted with clothing torn, she was a sight for sore eyes. He stepped forward towards her, even as she approached.\\n\\n\"Elise...?\"\\n\\n\"Jim. J-what are you doing here?\" Her voice was tired, incredibly so. But it was her. He stopped his approach and waved a hand around them.\\n\\n\"Here? Where even is here Elise? Where are we?\"\\n\\nElise hesitated in answering before she finally managed to speak.\\n\\n\"My basement?\"',\n",

Everyone asks if you’re a nurse when you work at the hospital, but their face falls when they learn you’re “just” a janitor. But “just” that janitor - sorry, “environmental services technician” - has to come clean up chemo puke and make the kid who just expelled it happy as possible while they do.  I study Pokémon like these nurses for the NCLEX. I can’t make you stop vomiting, but I can make you laugh acting like you’re bulbasaur jetting out a projectile while I clean it up.  \\nThat’s what Kadie is for me. \\nShe’s the one who makes even the hard, merciless days feel better, the one who makes me laugh when all I want to do is curl up and give up, when one more empty bed that doesn’t mean someone went home, but “went home” makes me want to quit and clean up a school somewhere or change hotel sheets rather than someone’s last bed.  She makes me want to be better; she makes me want to have something more to give than a cliched description of love.  I don’t deserve her, even if I feel like just being around her gets me closer to deserving her. \\nShe’s gorgeous, so I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised by the jewelry box full of rings.  It took everything in me not to give her one that first day she was downstairs in the food court, getting a coffee after seeing her niece. Sweet girl.  Loved batman and unicorns. Loved. Past tense.

But today, when that woman - I hate myself for letting it get to me, she had only lost her child an hour earlier, but dammit, she got to me - looked right at me like I was the trash I was sweeping up and asked me what the hell I was good for? How could I not? I had to ask, even if I got platitudes in return.  \\nI wish I had gotten platitudes.  \\nKadie couldn’t look me in the eye. The jewelry box was just the beginning. The safe was full of keys.  Safe deposit box keys.  She was crying as she told me. She couldn’t help herself.  The gold needed company.  She needed it, and it needed more. It wasn’t her niece.

You have a window view of a Volcano and the Ocean... from your Basement. Of your house in Topeka, Kansas?\" His voice couldn\\'t have dripped with any more disbelief and Elise wilted a bit at the sarcasm.\\n\\n\"Jim, I can explain. Please... Trust me. There is a perfectly rational... and plausible explanation for this... But please, let\\'s go back upstairs first. Please?\" She approached Jim slowly and carefully put an arm around him.\\n\\nJim could see the tiredness on her face and he nodded. He was sure that there had to be a reasonable answer, but his own brain couldn\\'t grasp it. He slipped one of his hands back around her and let her guide him back down the tunnel away from the window. They walked back out into the cavern, though Jim got the idea it wasn\\'t the same route he had come before. The floor was smooth and level though, and nothing would have changed that if his foot hasn\\'t caught a small object and sent it dancing into the dark. Jim turned his LED back on and found a trail of gold coins scattered across the cavern. The golden shine led to an even larger opening on the far side of the cave. Elise tried to lead him away, but Jim insisted on following the golden trail. The giant mound of gold added another layer of ridiculousness to the experience.\\n\\nIt was too much for Jim. He started laughing uncontrollably. After a full minute of laughter he managed to get out a few words.\\n\\n\"I... i\\'m dreaming... Right?\"\\n\\nElise continued to watch Jim quietly and intently.

Dragon?\"\\n\\nElise nodded with a soft smile. She still looked exhausted and dirty, though as she stepped towards the hoard, she almost glowed with an inner warmth\\n\\n\"Yes Jim... But there is a bit more to it as well. Here, come see.\"\\n\\nElise began to brush the gold and jewels away from the top of one of the smaller mounds. When Jim neared, he could see her uncovering a large shining stone from beneath the Treasure. He stared at it without comprehension for a long moment before he spoke.\\n\\n\"A... sculpture?\"\\n\\n\"An Egg...\" She corrected, \"And not the only one...\" \\n\\nShe pointed to another three lumps in the treasure horde, each of a similar size to the one that she began to bury again.Jim felt weak in the knees. His heart raced and his thoughts ricocheted off of one another. His mouth struggled to keep up with the disjointed thought process.\\n\\n\"Eggs. Four. Your eggs...\"\\n\\n\"Our Eggs, actually...\" She corrected him once again as she finished covering the egg and then turned back to him with a smile.\\n\\nJim\\'s confusion felt compounded now and he was reduced to a few syllables. He slid down to sit on the floor, to attempt to make the world stop spinning.\\n\\n\"But, how?\"\\n\\n\"I know what you are thinking...\" Elise began, \"How could it be yours if you are a human. And you are right. Humans and Dragons can\\'t breed like that. I mean, they can breed, but there wouldn\\'t be eggs. You would just get some Dragon Kin Humans. Magicians in the wild of man again. But no..\"\\n\\nElise approached Jim and slowly sat down in front of him. She met his eyes with her own and caught his gaze. She spoke clearly and concisely.\\n\\n\"Humans have a saying. \\'If it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck... it\\'s a duck.\\' But we Dragon\\'s have another saying... \\'If if looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck... Sometimes it\\'s a Dragon.\\' There is a reason you and your family don\\'t fit in Jim...\"\\n\\nElise had been leaning closer and closer to him as she spoke and when she finally rested her forehead against his she spoke again.\\n\\n\"It\\'s time to wake up Jimothy.\"\\n\\nJim felt a fire awaken.\\n\\nIf you enjoyed, please take a look at my other work at /r/The_Tales_of_Jimothy/\\n\\nEdited for spacing',\n",

       " 'We were working together and living together in the barracks for months, griping about all the same things. The magic started when I asked him out to dinner. That\\'s not really what happened. I asked him if he wanted to go get some pizza with me after a bad day in motorpool, and he said he didn\\'t have the money for it. In response I told him I\\'d cover it. \\n\\n\\nIt felt like static electricity when I was near him. We were in the same squad and petitioned leadership to move in with each other into a two-person room. Leadership knew we worked well together. They approved it. \\n\\n\\nHe was two years older than me. He was bigger than me. He was blonde and I thought he was beautiful even if he had a big potato-shaped Irish nose. I never thought him anything less than delightful. We wrestled a lot and I never got the better of him. We spent long nights rat-fucking each other with three pointers on NBA Jam (I think) 1997 on the Super Nintendo.\\n\\n\\nWe needed each other. We were good for each other. We played weird pranks on each other and we competed with each other. \"I fucking hate you\" was the highest compliment we could give one another. When he used say that I felt like a cat being pet against the grain. By him. I used to get so drunk with him that I\\'d fall asleep in his bed. \\n\\n\\nI used to think I wanted him to just fucking kiss me, but almost fifteen years on I wish I\\'d just been brave enough to kiss him first. This is all before DADT was struck down.\\n\\n\\nWhen we deployed to Iraq things went sideways. Lots of people died and he got reassigned to a squad that was a lot more dangerous than ours was. I literally reenlisted just to be near him. Worked it into my contract. We were together when things blew up, or we got shot at, and things exploded. I loved him with all my heart, and I literally signed away years of my life for the chance to die with him.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe always got each other. We did a lot of silly things, on purpose and accident, and to this day I wish I\\'d just picked a moment and kissed him. It doesn\\'t matter which of us, but I wish one of us was just a little stronger and more determined. \\n\\n\\nLooking back, there are so many times I wish I\\'d just fucking kissed him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is not fiction. I wish we\\'d both been more brave. I\\'ve never been more connected to another human being as him, and we had each other\\'s number. \\n\\n\\n\\nThis is not fiction. Is there an english word for \"You fight in a war and sacrifice yourself and do everything you\\'re supposed to, but want to kiss the man you\\'re with?\"\\n\\n\\nIs this a story or an admission? Is it something I lived through? Does it matter? I wish he\\'d kissed me. I wish I\\'d kissed him.',\n",

Not a twitch. \\n\\nCurious. I crept up to my human’s chair and clawed my way up the back. I meowed again right next to their ear. \\n\\nNot a twitch. \\n\\nI jumped into their lap.

What’s up?”\\n\\nJumping down from their lap, I made my way to the entrance, looking behind me to make sure my human was following. They did, and they opened the door to greet the human outside the entrance. There was some welcome respite from the screeching noise now. \\n\\nWashing my paws meditatively, I pondered the situation.

       " 'Squeak Squeak\\n\\nMy nose twitched as I endlessly trotted on my spin-wheel. It had been a long day. In the morning, soft hands had scooped me up and carried me away, taking me from everything I had ever known. \\n\\nAt first it had been exciting, new smells, free from the squawking and sniffles of my brethren. Warm arms that held me close. \\n\\nBut something wasn’t quite right. My needy squeaks for food and water had gone unanswered, and bumping the glass hadn’t even made the human turn around. \\n\\nNow it sat in front of a colorful window silently streaming colors across its surface, with white blocky scribbles popping up at the bottom, with its back to me. \\n\\nI kept trotting on my wheel. It felt comfortable, almost like I was back at my cozy corner instead of on top of a side table out in the open. Almost like I could ignore the ... quietness, the absolute stillness that felt heavy, only punctuated by the quiet squeaks of my wheel. I never thought I would miss the terrifying lizard hisses, or the piercing cries of the birds. Or even just hearing the quiet chatter and humans filtered past. There was none of that here.\\n\\nSqueak Squeak\\n\\nMy small legs felt tired. The wheel slowly ground to a halt. Now the silence was complete. I yearningly looked toward the human with the soft hands, but they didn’t notice the difference. In the silence, the squeaking had been deafening. I shuffled dejectedly, drooping, across the soft wood shavings. Perhaps food would come in the morning. By chance, I looked up.\\n\\nVertical pupils, almost glowing. A flash of whiskers. Claws out stretched, thin and translucent. Wickedly curved. Then my whole world spun. Falling. A thunderous crash. I woke up, weakly. My back paw wasn’t moving. I kept trying. Run. Run. Run. The instinct pounded in my head, driving every thought out of my mind. A self satisfied meow reverberated, physically vibrating in the air as I felt something monstrous slink up behind me. I scrabbled for purchase with my front legs, madly searching for anywhere to hide, anywhere to escape. Glass shards surrounded me. The fall had split the lid into two and spilled the enclosures contents skittering across the wood floor. There was no where to hide. Desperately I latched onto my only hope for survival, crying out in pain, terror, and desperation as a heavy paw settled on my body, claws slowly unsheathing. Surely the human would turn around at the crash, would reach out and pull me away from certain death. \\n\\nAs I stared up at a back that refused to turn, my eyes dimmed. My last thought was a realization. Perhaps, the human simply couldn’t hear us. Perhaps the human lived in a world where all was silent. It was not very comforting as fangs pierced the back of my neck.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nSighing, I turned off the TV. It was fully dark now, and I felt the exhale leave my chest. Sometimes I wondered what it sounded like. I doubted I would recognize it even if I could hear it. Oh well. Turning around I was stunned. The brand new terrarium I had bought was on the floor shattered, and the hamster I’d bought for my girlfriend was nowhere to be seen. I searched under the furniture, behind the couch, and even in the cabinets. Eventually I gave up and grabbed a dust pan. I guess we’d just have to share Mr. Nibbles for the time being.',\n",
       " 'Awwww I love this',\n",
       " 'That was good!! Just a little criticism: the deaf person would’ve likely felt the vibration of the terrarium hitting the floor if it was close enough for him to turn around and see it. Just letting you know, I’m deaf myself. Otherwise, I liked the dark twist',\n",
       " 'Thanks for the info! Funny, I didn’t consider that!  I tried to put myself in a deaf persons shoes but I’m sure it’s chock full of stereotypes. Thanks for reading!',\n",

       " '\"Get out of the way you damn ape\", the electronic translator said from behind me.  Despite my lack of understanding about why ape was an insult, the tone of the device still made my hand brush against the HN EmPp pistol on my belt, after all the between civils zone we were in didn\\'t have much for law.  But I didn\\'t bother confronting the speaker or just shooting them, instead I continued on just as I had before across the paved walkway of the mining town.\\n\\nI did however react when a large appendage forced me into the wall of a nearby store.  \"I said move it you glorified ape\".  My blood boiled, and I rolled against the wall so that my back was against it and I was facing the rude alien.  It was a Korn\\'sck as I had figured by his heavy footfalls and advanced level translator, they were big and mean but died to a 260 grain EmPp slug the same as everything else.\\n\\nThe 4 tentacles creature had stopped to face me when I rolled out from under his grasp.  Even with the clouded visor the species prefered I could see he wasn\\'t pleased.  My hand fell to the HN and I began to debate between unloading center mass, a double tap to the visor, or one to each of his robotic legs.  I decided the last option would be my choice if he gave me one more execuse.\\n\\nSilent tension fell upon the barren street and the space between us could have been cut with a knife it was so full of stress.  I had two advantages and I used both of them before the fight even got started, first I used my helmets wide field of view to heck for any backup the slug in a exoskeleton might have, then I subtly released my weapon from its holster with my thumb.  All I had to do was get the railgun level before he could close the five foot distance between us.\\n\\nI could feel sweat being wicked away by my underlayer as the suited up bug made his move.  Two of his tentacles wrapped around his own weapons grip while another hit the release and yet another swung for my gun hand.  Decent plan but poor execution.  I bunny hopped to the left and pulled my HN up and level, he had yet to even clear his holster when I hit the trigger.\\n\\nThe gun moved ever so slightly as magnets accelerated the projectile to 5,000 feet per second and put it through the metal joint of the Korn\\'sck\\'s left leg, my second shot went wide but my third downed the right and with it my opponent.\\n\\nHe managed to send a bolt of plasma a few feet away from my head as he fell but lost the grip on his weapon when the backside of his metal and glass sphere hit the ground.  \"Alright you son of a bitch, have you learned your mannners or do I need to send you on one last expedition into the great unknown\", I smiled as my translator chirped out the message and the object behind the clouded glass changed colors with rage.\\n\\n\"Fuck you, you own mother shit humping ape\", the translator angrily stated.  I\\'m guessing it sounded a lot worse in his native tongue but still fairly solid and very rude.  I aimed down the electronic projected sights, looked out of the corner of my eye for troublesome witnesses (which was mainly just tinhorns and the law in this part of the galaxy), and began to squeeze the trigger.  Then a long festering question popped into my head, how did they know about apes and why were our cousins so despised.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you what\", I drawled, \"explain why ape is an insult and I won\\'t waste you.\"\\n\\n\"Seriously human\", if it had been one of my fellow terrarians he would have been looking at me out of the corner of his eye.\\n\\n\"Yep, heard it a lot and have pretty well figured its an insult but never where you got it from\"\\n\\n\"Well when we first discovered you we abducted your closest animal relatives\", he was obviously still suspicious and paused his slow explanation.  His metal clad tentacles notably relaxed when I holstered my little friend.  \"They promptly destroyed and defecated on all of our interaction devices and became quite famous for their habits.  It was so bad that we were afraid to reveal ourselves to you terrarians even though you\\'re so very different from the apes.\"\\n\\nI tapped my glove against my visor as I considered the explanation.  \"By any chance were you guys responsible for the Harambe descendants clan disappearence in 2140\", I questiond\\n\\nThe now much more relaxed being seemed to smile with it\\'s three bluish red orbs, \"yes we did abduct a clan of apes with Haram paternal tattoos on them that human year, they were actually quite tame in comparison to the others.  In fact I remember watching them and thinking maybe contact with your people wouldn\\'t be so bad after all\".\\n\\n\"What did you do with them\", I asked, eager to finally answer two great mysteries.\\n\\nThe Korn\\'sck\\'s apparent smile disappeared \"Well, are standard procedure is to disect all subjects at the end of behavioral studies.\", he nervously paused as if sensing the weight his answer would carry, \"and are technology is still primitive enough that we must kill an animal to do so.\". Silence hung in the air, apparently he didn\\'t think this dumb ape understood, \" they weren\\'t given special treatment or exception\".\\n\\nI was right about 260 grain slugs and Korn\\'scks.',\n",

       " 'One day when I was a kid, I was making faces at myself in the giant mirror at the end of the hallway. It was a fun way to pass the time until I noticed something odd: one time the mirror-me blinked when I didn\\'t. My laughter faded away as I leaned forward to study my reflection. It was back to reflecting exactly what I did. I thought that maybe I\\'d imagined it.\\n\\nYears later, it happened again. I hadn\\'t just imagined it all those years ago. The mirror wasn\\'t showing me a simple reflection. There was someone mimicking me on the other side. \\n\\nI began to suspect that mirrors -- or at least that giant mirror in the hallway -- was some sort of doorway to another dimension. I began to think that the only stopping me from getting through was that reflection. I came up with a plan.\\n\\nSo, a year ago, I began a ritual. Come hell or high water, I\\'ve done this exact routine every single day. At exactly 9:15 PM I would walk into the hallway, spin around clockwise once, hop the remaining distance to the mirror, then turn and lean on it with my right shoulder. Mirror-me, of course, always did the exact same thing. Today, I\\'ll complete the rest of plan and find out if my theory is correct. If this works, I\\'ll know I was right. If it doesn\\'t, well, either I\\'m crazy or the mirror-me is smarter than I gave him credit for.\\n\\nThe moment of truth arrives. At exactly 9:15 PM I would walk into the hallway, spin around clockwise once, hop the remaining distance to the mirror, then turn and lean on it with my *left* shoulder. It works! Mirror-me leans the wrong way and we each fall through the mirror to the other side.\\n\\nI turn around to look at the mirror. Mirror-me does the same. I laugh, and so does he. Strangely though, I notice his teeth look different than mine. They look like they have a small pair of fangs. Before I can dwell on it too long though, he marches out of the hallway and turns the corner. Against my will, I\\'m dragged out of the room so that the mirror is no longer visible. I can only come out when he\\'s standing there? What have I done?\\n\\nTrying my hardest not to panic, I take a look around the room. This room looks amazingly like my own house (although mirrored, of course), but everything has a sort of haze around it. It\\'s almost like I\\'m looking at everything through a fog.\\n\\nA few minutes later, I\\'m startled when there\\'s a knock at the front door. I start walking that way when I\\'m teleported straight to the front door. I blink in confusion for a bit before it dawns on me. I would have had to walk in front of the mirror to get here. Since I can\\'t do that without mirror-me on the other side, I guess it just teleports me instead.\\n\\nSlowly opening the door, I see my mother standing there on the front step. Before I can get a word out, she says, \"Let me in.\" Something feels wrong about this interaction. Obviously it\\'s strange that she wouldn\\'t give any kind of greeting or explanation for being there. But also, there\\'s something that just feels *different* about her. I shake my head and start to push the door closed. More insistently this time, she repeats, \"Let. Me. In.\" The request leaves me even more convinced that I shouldn\\'t comply.\\n\\nSuddenly, a man I\\'ve never seen before charges at my mother. He tackles her from the side, leaps up, shoves his way through the doorway, then slams the door shut. I stumble backwards, shocked.\\n\\nWithout preamble, the man pushes himself away from the door and says, \"You let him through, didn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Who are you? And why the hell did you tackle my mother?!\"\\n\\nThe man tells me to sit down. Feeling like I don\\'t actually have a choice, I comply. He paces back and forth in front of me as he speaks. \"That\\'s *not* your mother. It looks like her, but it\\'s not. Do *not* under any circumstances let her in. Don\\'t let *any* of them in. You\\'re safe in here as long as you don\\'t give them permission to enter.\"\\n\\n\"What? I don\\'t...\"\\n\\n\"Vampires are real.\" I open my mouth to protest, but he just continues in a louder voice. \"Yes, they are. And this is the realm they\\'ve been banished to. As long as their human counterpart is on the other side, the vampire version is held prisoner here, bound by the mirror. You tricked yours and managed to switch places with him. Now you\\'re the one who\\'s trapped.\"\\n\\n\"Wh... How did you know what happened?\"\\n\\nHe stops pacing to glare at me. \"How do you think? Years ago, I did the same thing!\" He resumes pacing. \"I can feel it now when someone happens to do the same thing.\"\\n\\n\"I let a *vampire* into the world?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you did.\" He stops to look at me again, but his expression softens. \"As long as you stay here, he\\'s still tethered to the mirror. He can\\'t actually hurt anyone right now. Well, I should say that he *won\\'t* hurt anyone. He *can* still hurt others, but as long as you\\'re here, he won\\'t feel the need to hurt anyone. That was the backup plan for if any of them tricked their way out.\"\\n\\n\"Well... Um... What if I just trick my way back out the next time he\\'s in front of the mirror?\"\\n\\n\"You can\\'t.\" The pacing resumes. \"You didn\\'t *trick* him in the first place. He set you up. Just accept it, this is your fate now.\" Giving me one final glare, he turns toward the door. \"I\\'ll be back to check on you in a few days. Stay in the house and don\\'t let anyone in except me!\"\\n\\nNo. I won\\'t let this be my fate. For three days, I sit patiently, waiting for mirror-me to walk up to the mirror. Finally, I feel the pull as I\\'m dragged into the hallway to fulfill my duty as the reflection. He walks forward, and I do, too. He smiles and I feel my expression change as well. He walks all the way up to the mirror and tauntingly waves at me. I fight the urge to copy him and lean forward. It takes all my willpower, but I manage to push hard enough to break through the spell. A moment later, I fall forward, and back into my home world.\\n\\nFrom my spot on the floor, I look upward at my vampire counterpart. His pupils dilate and his smile turns into a sneer. I watch in horror as his subtle fangs grow until they protrude past his bottom lip. \\n\\nI need to jump back through the mirror. Before I can react though, the vampire has pinned me to the ground and I feel his sharp fangs pierce my neck.\\n\\nAs I feel myself weakening, I turn my head to the mirror. I can only see an empty hallway reflected there. What have I done? Why didn\\'t I listen? What have I unleashed on the world? \\n\\n\\\\--------------\\n\\nr/WannaWriteSometimes',\n",
       " 'The glass, as if on hinges, fell backwards.\\n\\nThe magician looked on as it swung backwards - *into* the mirror itself -  and his duplicate, behind the frame, narrowly dodged to the left.\\n\\nHe swallowed once and took the chance.\\n\\nThe magician jumped into the frame, after the glass, and dodged to the right as it swung back into the mirror\\'s frame, snapping into place once more. He turned and looked his doppelganger in the eyes.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt had not been easy to open the mirror. The magician had first found mention of it looking for new and better tricks - he wasn\\'t a very good magician, to be fair, and his crowd was shrinking by the performance. He\\'d gotten hold of a book at his local library. It was dusty, dry, and banned in seven countries, but it had had what he\\'d wanted. The next evening the magician tried an adapted version of a trick meant to summon a duplicate of yourself.\\n\\nIt worked like a charm. The magician set up the mirrors and made the gestures, and the crowd went wild as his copy appeared on the scene.\\n\\nThen the copy looked at the magician and *grinned*.\\n\\nHe had managed to keep his composure until the show was over. Then he practically ran back to the library to find the book. He was told that the Vatican had bought it for an inordinate amount of money and apparently burnt it as soon as they\\'d had the chance. He\\'d spent the rest of the night looking for wind of more copies. Most had met a similar fate, but he had seen mention of a similar tome in Kazan, belonging to a collector who refused to sell to the Orthodox Church. The magician had found himself an excellent thief and soon had the tome in his possession. A month of research and he\\'d been ready to attempt a ritual.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe doppelganger smiled. The magician did not.\\n\\n\"You are here for the bargain?\"\\n\\nThe magician jumped and realized the voice came from the doppelganger. It was nothing like his own. He didn\\'t relax. The book hadn\\'t mentioned anything about this.\\n\\n\"I am here for the bargain,\" he decided.\\n\\n\"Good,\" said the doppelganger. \"We will now discuss the price.\"\\n\\n\"The price of what?\" asked the magician.\\n\\nThe doppelganger looked surprised. Then it smiled. \"A wise sorcerer. Many assume that the standard bargain will always apply. Do you know a man once sold me his soul for a fingernail?\" The copy laughed, a barking, unpleasant sound. \"To the point. You will receive power over your own reflection. You may see and hear whatever a reflection sees and hears. You will be given protection from others who have made this bargain. Is that enough?\"\\n\\n\"It is,\" said the magician. \"What will I pay?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, what will you pay?\" The doppelganger cocked it\\'s head. \"Different people pay different things. Talents, memories, ideas, souls. But you don\\'t have any of that. A little, yes, but not enough for us. No, I think there is only one thing that you could give us.\"\\n\\nThe magician\\'s mouth went dry. \"Which is?\"\\n\\n\"Your destiny,\" replied the doppelganger. \"You sorcerers - you *humans* all have a little destiny on you. It holds you to what should happen, ties time together, and keeps you at least a little safe. Call it luck, or God, or the universe\\'s sense of humor. We want yours.\"\\n\\nThe magician hardly considered. He certainly hadn\\'t noticed any luck. A mediocre magician turned thief. Destiny! Chain was a better word. The magician would be unchained.\\n\\n\"I accept,\" he said.\\n\\nThe doppelganger laughed again. \"Wonderful! You won\\'t regret this, sorcerer.\" It smiled, a sly, cruel smile. \"Or maybe you will. Who can say? You don\\'t have a destiny any more.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s already gone?\" asked the magician.\\n\\n\"And always will be!\" said the doppelganger. \"The mirror will open for you. A pleasure doing business, sorcerer.\"\\n\\nAs the magician turned around, the doppelganger started laughing. It kept laughing as the mirror snapped back. It kept on until the magician was safely out of sight. Then it stopped.\\n\\nThe doppelganger muttered a few words and made a complicated pattern in the air.

       " '“So Artavious, would you like to test the mettle of your shield against my sword?” the mysterious said, steel penetrating his words. “I’ve searched long and have heard tale of your might. Or is it the shield that makes the man?”\\n\\n\\n“I would have the name of the man who seeks to embark on such a foolish endeavor!” Artavious demanded. This knight standing in front of him seemed formidable but the plain leather bounded long sword in his gauntleted hand seemed less than impressive. “This shield was crafted by the greatest wizard of our nation. No instrument of mortals could even make a gash in it.” Pride entering his voice. “And it is King Artavious you speak to now. Shield of His People”\\n\\n“The name of your conqueror is Bailon. I have come to put an end to the only thing that could stop this sword from being the greatest weapon this earth has ever seen.” He looked at this fool in front of him. All this king was clothed with was fine silk. Bailon couldn’t see any hidden knives tucked away. “Maybe all he had was this shield.”, He thought “If I can cut into it, I can end him swiftly.” Besides, despite all he had heard of this magical item, the leather banded circle in front of him seemed simple of make. \\n\\n“You’re in luck, king Artavious.” He said, putting as much scorn into the title as he possibly could. “For today your line ends today at the hands of the Warrior King Bailon. Now come, let us test our wills against each other.”\\n\\n\\nArtavious started forward before his retainer stopped him with worry in his eyes. “Sir! Maybe it’s best to rethink this path. If he does have a mighty blade you could be putting yourself at great harm.” \\n\\nIgnoring him, Artavious turned to his new opponent and started forward, roaring a challenge.\\n\\nBailon rushed in with his sword held high, ready to cut into this false king’s only defense. \\n\\nThe two artifices met each other with a scream of steel and metal. Sparks flew as a crack resounded through the air, deafening all those who stood near as the impact sent both kings sprawling to the ground.\\n\\nBoth kings sat up in confusion, each looking down at their mighty armaments. Artavious’ shield had been cleaved half way down it’s body while Bailon’s sword had snapped clean at the middle of the blade. \\n\\n“How could this be?” Both kings said at the same time then glaring at each other. Bailon got to his feet first. “How could the sword have failed? The grand witch Petrovich had guaranteed it’s power!” He exclaimed. \\n\\nArtavious froze in place. “What did you say!?” He demanded. “Grand witch what?!”\\n\\n“Petrovich. Simonne Petrovich. She is the witch that has been my consultant for years. At my behest she crafted me this sword. It took her a while to come around but I finally convinced her it might be fatal otherwise.” Bailon mused. “Why?”\\n\\nArtavious stared at his shield, the instrument he had wielded since his reign began. “The wizard who crafted this is named Simon Petrovich.” Shock flooded through him. Quickly followed by a torrent of hate. He looked up to see Bailon working through the same revelation. “It seems we have been duped, sir.” Artavious said, anger seeping into his words. \\n\\n“So it would seem.” Bailon acknowledged. The sting of this betrayal hit him closer than he would admit. “It seems we must find this charlatan and make an example of what happens when you try to fool the royalty of this world.” \\n\\nThe two men nodded and thus the hunt for the infamous Petrovich began.',\n",

       " '(WP) The Puppeteers \\n\\nMy kind isn’t exactly heard of, but I wouldn’t give up my senses for anything. Even before someone opens their mouth, I can see what kind of person they are. People-watching is one of my favorite pasttimes. Over an iced coffee, I gather all I need to know. A few notes of a powerful perfume, the hint of a dimple in someone’s face, the specific color of a person’s eyes; all a synesthete needs really needs to thrive are sharp powers of observation. \\n\\nFor the most part, no one notices me, and I’m perfectly fine with that. I’m one of the last, and the reason I’ve survived this long is because I’ve been able to stay hidden. The global government tried to round us all up, turn us into the next batch of super-soldiers. Some families fled their homes or went into hiding; others all-out fought for their children’s freedom. The ones who were caught were experimented on, or used as spies in sleeper units around the world. \\n\\nMe, I left before they could catch me, and I’ve been on the run ever since. I’m alone, and though sometimes I miss connection with others, I’d rather be lonely than dead. \\n\\nOur powers don’t actually manifest until puberty; that was why it took so long for the government to even catch wind of us all. They didn’t even wait for us to grow up; they just sent men dressed in sharp black suits to round us up and put us in cages to be observed. \\n\\nWhen they found out that stress and high emotions were one of our triggers, that was when things really started to get out of control. Our powers had bloomed, and it got to the point where some of us were able to not just read a person, we could control their emotions, or fool them with their own senses. \\n\\nSome of the captives took it a little far, but it’s not like I could blame them. They were being tortured, all so the government could use their powers for its own gain. The night we’d made a break for it, one of the prisoners had killed a guard and a scientist, all to make a distraction. I can still hear the scream of the sirens and the wounded and dying, regular human and synesthete alike, even this many years later. \\n\\nFifteen of us escaped, but only myself and another kid, a boy with dark brown hair and amber eyes, made it out of the lab and into the city. I am still haunted by their screams, by the blood that was shed for us to escape. I don’t know where the other boy is; I only hope that he made it out and was able to have a normal life. \\n\\nOn days like this, I wish for a normal life: a lover, a couple of kids, a house with a white picket fence and several pets, but for whatever reason, that kind of life wasn’t meant for us. \\n\\nNo, better to stay hidden. \\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\xa0',\n",

       " \"It all started with a gut feeling. A strong gut feeling, like something Larger whispering in my ear. I should build a boat. A really, frickin big boat. We worked for months, my sons and I, humming the old tune under our breaths.\\n\\n*Rain, rain, go away. Go, come back another day.*\\n\\nAfter all, applying the mud coat to the hull in the rain would be a bitch. And the ancient tune seemed to be working, on the whole. Usually.\\n\\nAs the boat started taking shape, the walls rising around the almost perfectly circular bottom, people came to watch us work. Sometimes they helped. Mostly they didn't, having come only to gawk at the old fool with the impossibly big boat, miles from any coast or major river. \\n\\nThe months moved on. We wove the reeds into a hut to put on top of the top deck. I started to worry about what would come next. I had felt such purpose in the building. I had felt more impossibly sure and driven that, now, with the finished boat only a few days away, I was unsure of what to do next.\\n\\nAs I sat under a tree, jotting down my straying thoughts on a spare clay, I heard them. The animals. As if moved by something Larger. They had come. Only two of each. The calm sheep in front of the docile wolves. I stared. And I let them enter.\\n\\nThe next day, we did not sing the ancient tune.\\n\\nAnd the rains came.\",\n",

       " '\"Laddie, mind shuttin up for a wee bit, eh? Am tryin to get some sleep down \\'ere!\" the small grumpy old man said as he slithered back down to the floor.\\n\\n\"Wha–Who are you?! Mum! Dad!\"\\n\\nHearing the child scream, the little old man stood back up and flailed his arms in panic. He had not wished to startle the child, he simply wanted the child to be neighbourly. Yet the child\\'s screams only got worse as he tried to plead.\\n\\n\"Listen, shhh! I\\'m sorry, laddie! Didn\\'t mean to scare the bejesus out of ye, I swear on me mother\\'s dead ash–\"\\n\\nThe child looked on in horror and cried. It seemed endless. The little old man had to come up with something a child would quickly pick up on. He took out a rucksack from underneath the bed and shoved his blackened hands in. He rattled and mixed the contents until suddenly...\\n\\n\"Look!\" the little old man pulled a bunny, \"there\\'s a cute wee bunny in \\'ere! You like to give it a teeny weeny pat in the head?\"\\n\\nThe child\\'s cries stopped into a sob. He looked unsure and shook his head in response. Clearly, the little old man was what keeping him back.\\n\\n\"Righto, how \\'bout we leave the wee bunny \\'ere on your bed and you can rub the fluffy bit on the back? You\\'d do that?\"\\n\\nThe child looked on, anticipation shone in his small beady eyes. By this point he had been hypnotised by the little furry creature. The little old man picked this up and smiled to himself.\\n\\n*That\\'s it ye little gremlin, look at it... Just don\\'t mind me so I can go back to me hole with some peace and quiet!* He thought to himself full of glee.\\n\\nThe rabbit sat on the child\\'s bed, some way away from the little old man. It then bounced up-and-down, side-to-side, shaking its fluffy stubby tail. The child ate it up and began doing the same. The excitement filled the room with colour and laughter.\\n\\nIt was all going great until the little old man heard an all too familiar noise.\\n\\n\"Billy!\" a muffled voice of a woman echoed behind the door.\\n\\n*Ah ye yappy tot!* the little old man bang his head in anger.\\n\\n\"Billy, eh?\" he said with an awkward smile, \"look to the wee fluffy bunny! I think it\\'s tryin\\' to say somethin\\' to ye!\"\\n\\nThe child turned silent and began to look deeply towards the bunny. His eyes were wide and beady, his pupils dilated. As he stopped to sit down on his bed, the little old man whispered...\\n\\n\"Ye tell yer giantess of a mother nothin\\' is wrong – say \\'apologies\\' and just nod. No one else is \\'ere and that the bunny was a gift from yer wee friends!\"\\n\\nWith that, the little old man hurriedly slid back down to his \\'hole under the bed\\'. The previously ecstatic bunny fell to its side, unmoving. The child simply sat in silence, his eyes empty.\\n\\n\"Billy!\" the door slammed opened, \"what is going on here?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, mother,\" he responded calmly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s *way* past your bedtime. Go to bed now or you won\\'t feel well tomorrow at school!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, mother. Apologies.\"\\n\\n\"Apo... I\\'m sorry?\" his mother looked on in disbelief, \"I never heard you use that word before. Did they teach you that in school?\"\\n\\n*Blasted tot! Say sorry or somethin\\', c\\'mon!* the little old man kept to his frustration.\\n\\n\"Yes... Mother.\"\\n\\n\"Uh-huh. Also,\" his mother turned her head around before leaving, \"you say \\'mum\\', not \\'mother\\'. I think you ought to know that.\"',\n",
       " 'Not again. \\n\\nCan’t a monster have a little peace and quiet once in a while. I’ve had a long day. I come back here hoping for a nice sleep but the neighbours are at it again. \\n\\nI put a pillow over my face hoping to muffle the sounds. It almost works. But a couple of sharp sounds penetrate my blockade. Sighing, I wonder if I just have to say something. \\n\\nBut almost as I’m about to go and talk to them about it, the sounds stop. For a while that is. After about ten minutes, there’s another sound. This one constant and low. Ugh. This is stupid. I decide I have to do something about this. \\n\\nI get out from under the bed and look at the room.\\n\\nThe occupant of the bed has their back towards me. I can see hints of movement so I know they are awake. I can hear the constant sound still. \\n\\nI cough a little, hoping to catch their attention. At the same time, I move back into the shadows. My first appearance can be a bit scary. And i don’t want to screw up my sleep any more than it already has. \\n\\nThe kid turns around and looks at me, terror apparent in his face. As he looks at me, something weird happens. His eyes calm down, a look of relief on his face. \\n\\nI move forward towards him, noticing the wet cheeks and the black eye. \\n\\n“Who are you?”\\n\\n“I... I live downstairs. Under your bed.”\\n\\n“Ok.”\\n\\nHe lies back down. I’m a bit confused. Most people who look at me usually shout or scream. I’m at the top of my game. Surely, this kid should be terrified. \\n\\n“Hey kid. Don’t I scare you?”\\n\\n“Yeah. Kinda.”\\n\\n“Hmm ok. Try and keep it quiet will you. I have to get some sleep. I’ve got a bunch of hauntings tomorrow.”\\n\\n“Sorry. I’ll keep quiet.” \\n\\nAnd to my surprise, he does. Looks the kid is good at following orders. When someone tells him to be quiet, he stays quiet. \\n\\nThe next night is quite silent. But there’s something bothering me. Something I haven’t understood yet. I have had a super productive day today. People shouted when they saw me. Someone even pissed  their pants. Yet this kid...\\n\\n“Hey kid. You up?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“It’s quiet today.”\\n\\n“Yeah. Dad’s went to bed early today. He’s got an early shift tomorrow so he didn’t drink.”\\n\\n“Hmm ok.”\\n\\n“Are you always here? Under my bed?”\\n\\n“I am.”\\n\\n“Thank you.”\\n\\nI wonder why he’s thanking me as I fall asleep.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nI hear a shout upstairs. Another bad day. Damn it. \\n\\n“Hey kid...”\\n\\nNo response. I wonder what he’s doing up there. \\n\\nI get out from my apartment and peek into his. \\n\\nAn adult stands there a belt tied around his hand. The kid seems to be crying. \\n\\n“Hey mister.”\\n\\nThe man’s eyes widen as he looks at me. “What... who...”\\n\\n“What are you doing?”\\n\\nI look at the kid who is holding on to his back. \\n\\nI look from the kid to the man and it finally clicks. \\n\\nI finally understand the look of relief. He obviously knows monsters much worse than me. \\n\\nI widen my eyes and put my game face on. \\n\\nThe man stumbles backwards. I put my hand on his shoulder. “Touch him again and I’ll show you hell.”\\n\\nThe man runs out. \\n\\nThe kid looks at me with moist eyes. “He’s going to be angry.”\\n\\n“It’s ok. I’m here for you. Not all monsters are that bad.”\\n\\n*******\\n\\nMore Of my ramblings at r/ta_account_12',\n",
       " 'Nights proved to be relatively uneventful down here. Peace, silence, darkness, the three things I thrived upon. This apartment was my treasure. Moving about, I prepared for a quick nap. My normal bedtime was still a ways away, but I had a little too much fun today. The gathering had left me woozy, filled to the brim with drinks and other intoxicants.\\n\\nBreathing out, I pulled the blanket up when the sounds of my neighbor moving about threw me back into the waking world. There they went, making a racket once more. It happens from time to time. I could forgive them for that. However, it was just too much tonight.\\n\\nConfrontation was not my desired route of action, but with my luck, I happened to be extra irritated today. Calming my nerves, I made my move. Leaning out, I decided to knock some sense into him, “Hey! Could you keep it down?”\\n\\nHe spoke at the same time as me, effectively drowning out my words, “Hey! Could you keep it down?”\\n\\nStaring, back at each other, we both extended a finger to point at one another. My neighbor, he appeared to be a carbon copy of me. In unison, we both muttered the same phrase, “I’ve had too much today, haven’t I?”\\n\\nCollapsing back under the bed, sleep was about to overtake me when the reality of the sight I saw dawned upon me. Shooting back out, I stared at my neighbor. He mimicked my actions, and also happened to be glaring daggers down upon me.\\n\\nWe spoke in unison once, “Hey! Why do you look like me?” Heaving out a sigh, I retreated back underneath the bed. Above me, I heard his body thud upon his mattress.\\n\\nShifting about, sleep was once more in my grasp, when shuffling sounds from above filled the space. Taken back once more, I was prepared to see if he would mimic my actions once more, but the lull of sleep proved to be too great.\\n\\n“I’ll just deal with this when I wake up.”\\n\\n“I’ll just deal with this when I wake up.” my neighbor called back [from above.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualScribblings/)',\n",

       " 'At first I had a good laugh. The old hag\\'s \"curse\" was the most adorable thing I\\'d ever seen. As I went to take a bite, the pink frosted muffin\\'s eyes popped open, it\\'s little oval smile gaped at me with blissful awe. It giggled and danced on its pudgy little legs in the palm of my hand. I may have cried a little, even, it was that cute. I set him on my shoulder, and we marched away, sharing a laugh as we went.\\n\\nThat was 50 hours ago. The muffin is dead. It wasn\\'t me, no, the seagull however didn\\'t hesitate to snatch him right off my shoulder while we were laughing, some minutes later. I hadn\\'t even taken a selfie with him yet. It screamed the whole way up in to the sky, into the clouds. Were that it, I\\'d have felt punished enough. But it wasn\\'t. I cried, for real this time. Some hours later, I made my way home. Some hours after that, I opened the fridge, and things got worse.\\n\\nEver made a bowl of soup? And two big blue eyes float to the surface to look at you? My milk moos. The rice cluster together into little effigy statues of me, little tiny voices squealing with happiness. My beer belches and tells me jokes. And once it\\'s alive, it\\'s alive. I can\\'t turn it off. Well, unless, you know. I had to bag them all up and dump them in a neighbors bin.\\n\\nInto the second day I learned there were... loopholes. If something is already alive then I can just eat it. Living plants in the soil. Crickets under a rock. Carpenter ants. I\\'ve stopped by the pet shop every day for mealworms, they\\'re starting to get suspicious. Parmesan cheese I can hear, but it\\'s little screams are so small I can generally drown them out with some heavy metal.\\n\\nIt\\'s not enough. I need nutrients. So, today I bought a summer sausage. Even now it\\'s sitting on the counter, still innate. I\\'ve prepared the straps on the cutting board, sharpened the knives, drawn the curtains. It\\'s going to be a long night.',\n",
       " 'I have a webcomic called Things in Squares. I started it out of boredom one day, a few years back. Freelance writing was paying the bills, barely, but it was sapping my soul of any vestige of creativity. Making comics filled that void. Sometimes they came out as you\\'d expect: relateable. Other times, I\\'d put disturbing images in front of you, and it was hit or miss. But one constant was the element of *adorable. Cutesy.* *Innocent*, or whatever. I used anthropomorphism to bring anything inanimate to life, and gave living things tiny kawaii faces whether they were evil or not. The point is, the webcomic was cute and disturbing.\\n\\nI haven\\'t published much recently, but I find time to doodle in a small sketchbook that I keep bedside. Recently I found myself drawing a picture of an apple who was telling off a rose for being a prick. I happen to like apples--gala, specifically. So I was drawing, and had a nice cold gala apple fresh from the refrigerator. I was about to take my first bite when I heard a giggle straight from the mouth of a heavenly child, or so it seemed. The gala apple was *alive*! It had the cutest face I\\'d ever seen. It looked a little bit like my drawing actually, but instead of lewd dialogue it just looked at me with orbs so innocent I could cuddle the thing. I did--I cuddled that gala apple.\\n\\nBut this wasn\\'t right, I thought. How was my gala apple suddenly alive? Its face was kawaii, no doubt, but utterly realistic, with form, light and shadow. I could almost imagine its little throat, and stomach, and all the other organs. I was gonna check for a butthole but caught myself. Inappropriate. The gala apple looked at me sweetly. I couldn\\'t eat it--obviously I couldn\\'t eat him. Real life isn\\'t like comics; life matters here.\\n\\nMy little gala apple didn\\'t say any words, but I got the sense it was sentient when it giggled like a baby when tickled. I set it back on the nightstand.\\n\\nHell if I was going to tell anyone. Something cosmic was taking place, and it had to have something to do with my comics. How else could such a thing befall me? It can\\'t be coincidence. All I knew was that I had to take care of the gala apple. Still, I was hungry so I backed out of my room and rushed down to the kitchen to fetch some saltines, returning in under twenty seconds to admire the new life.\\n\\nI swear, the gala apple yawned and blinked its big round face all at once--so utterly adorable.\\n\\nIt was a new package of saltines so I tore it open, only to be greeted by a chorus of tiny voices saying \"oohh\". Shocked, I looked into the bag, and found a column of sentient saltine crackers peering back at me, curious, cute, and loveable. Oh. My. God. (I\\'ve always hated the phrase, being an athiest, but something about calling out God makes it all the more potent when you don\\'t believe in him). *God*, I whispered. My *God*!\\n\\nSo it has been two days. My mom called and she threatened to come over if I didn\\'t eat something. I shouldn\\'t have mentioned anything. I didn\\'t tell her about the gala apple--apples, now--or the saltines, or the burger patties, or hell even the bottle of worcestershire. I didn\\'t reveal that I was living among an indispensable cohort of new life. I only said that I hadn\\'t eaten much when she asked why my voice sounded off. I hung up soon after. I can\\'t deal with that right now.\\n\\nIt has been difficult to admit but... I\\'m starving.\\n\\nAnd for all the wrong reasons. Insanity? I don\\'t know. I haven\\'t tried to show this discovery to anyone. What if they don\\'t see the cute little sentience shuffling about the pantry? It\\'ll mean I\\'ve gone mad and am truly lost. What if my buddy Eric comes over to play some Call of Duty and he\\'s sitting there slurping the actual fucking life out of a glass of orange juice? Will that even happen? Will these things *die* if I try to consume them? Will the OJ scream bloody murder as it\\'s emptied into Eric\\'s fat-ass belly? God. GOD.\\n\\nSo I can\\'t cook. I can\\'t munch on anything. Even sunflower seeds are alive. I had to immediately close the lid on my jar of sunflower seeds. You think you\\'ve seen cute and adorable? You have *not*\\\\--not until you\\'ve experienced the sunflower seeds--you. have. not.\\n\\nAnd I obviously can\\'t draw my anthropomorphic creations. It\\'s too absurd, now that it\\'s fucking not at all absurd. It\\'s all right here. And I\\'m in cute phase. If I can\\'t resist the hunger, will my experience of these living things become unbearably cruel and maddening as I murder them with my incisors? I can\\'t think about it.\\n\\nAll I know is that I need to process this. So I got on reddit, logged into my second account, /u/sergalahadabeer/, and posted a writing prompt. Apart from comics, prompt responses are pretty good creative outlets. I responded with my comic account so you know it\\'s me. I need help. I\\'m so hungry, and I can\\'t bring myself to bite something as adorable and huggable as a beaming slice of bread; I can\\'t muster the resolve to nibble on a jolly tomato; and I sure as hell can\\'t be so base as to lick a fawning cookie. ...I won\\'t be able to resist devouring the Oregon dark cherry Tillamook ice cream... no matter how chirpy and snuggly and innocent it may be! \\n\\nMy God, Reddit. Help me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n/r/velabasstuff',\n",
       " \" “It’s hardest the first time.”\\n\\n“The first time I bit into an apple and it screamed was hard. The first time I saw a child sucking on a lollipop and heard the lollipop scream out in agony as it begged for mercy was hard. The first time I tried to explain this condition – this curse – to my girlfriend was hard. Watching her leave was even harder. But I get it. I sound like an insane person. You get used to it though. The insanity.”\\n\\n“I found ways to adapt. On the edge of starvation, I discovered that I could stomach drinking smoothies. You see, the curse seems to work based on observation. As soon as I see an item of food it comes to life - all bright eyed and eager to give me a hug – its adorable and terrifying. So what I do is go in, ask to look at the fruit, and turn away as soon as I see the eyes appear. Then I order the smoothie, throw on my noise canceling headphones, and wait out their screams.”\\n\\n“Still it’s impossible to avoid completely. I’ve lost twenty pounds in three weeks, used up every saved day of vacation, and avoided everyone I know. Do you know how often people eat?! Like all the time! Just last week my brother invited himself over, and when I opened the door he was eating a bag of potato chips.”\\n\\n“‘Hey bro,’ he said. Then out comes the potato chip, ‘I’m alive!’ Then in to my brother’s mouth it goes and – CRUNCH! ‘Oh GOD Life is pain!’ I hear it scream.”\\n\\n“‘You okay, dude!’ Is all my brother said as I stared horrified at the remnant of that newly born life stuck in between his teeth. And then he takes out another chip. ‘Wow life is great! Where’s my brother?’ CRUNCH!”\\n\\n“I threw up on his shoes, but fortunately that was enough to get him to leave and I could tell him that I was just suffering from the flu. Not an insane curse where food springs to life every time I look at it.”\\n\\nI took a deep breath and sighed.\\n\\n“I think you can find some sympathy for the position I’m in. This is certainly no way to live, so I made a decision. Today, at this very table I’m taking my life back from this curse.”\\n\\nThe grape on the table looked up at me with wide eyes. Happy and a little confused. It was wearing a tiny sailor suit and wobbled around just a little. The perfect amount to emote innocence and life.\\n\\n“I would say it’s nothing personal. But the truth is it’s the most personal thing in the world. A test of my will power over the curse, so I wanted to take this last moment to say that I’m sorry.”\\n\\n“Sorry?” The grape asked, “why should you be sorry? You gave us life and your my best friend and” the grape looked away a little shy, then back at me, its eyes glistening with admiration, “and I love you!”\\n\\nI reached out and tossed the grape in my mouth. \\n\\n“AH! Help me friend! I’m scared!” \\n\\nI held the grape in my mouth for just a moment, a moment of hesitation, and then – \\n\\nCRUNCH\\n\\nThe grape screamed. A scream that rattled my head. I forced back the urge to throw up or spit it out. I focused on its blood – the juice, it’s juice, it's just juice – going down my throat. God it tasted delicious! I bit again, and again, until the echoes of the scream died away.\\n\\n“Okay,” I said to myself looking at the bowl of terrified grapes in front of me, “it’s hardest the first time.”\",\n",
       " '„God left me unfinished!” Were the first and last words of scrambled eggs as I put them in my mouth. They were right, I should’ve left them on the pan for a bit longer.\\n\\nNext, I ate bacon with their cute little voices and washed it down with coffee. Liquids are the weirdest, they always make those gargling noises when you drink them.\\n\\n“Another noisy breakfast? I wonder how much longer will it keep up.”\\n\\n“Yeah, I’m sick of food trying to guilt-trip me. It’s been like what 3 months already?”\\n\\nThe person, or rather a thing, I was talking with was my friend Pam. He’s a slice of whole wheat bread that came to life three months ago. I was making sandwiches one morning when suddenly, while I was cutting bread, all the ingredients came to life. I wasn’t shocked for long as I started to fear that I might get my ass kicked by a bunch of greens. Thankfully, it turned out they can’t move an inch. After a long fight with my breakfast I came out victorious and well fed. A whole cabbage, a jar of pickles, even whole loaf of bread came to life. After all that I just couldn’t force myself to eat anything else. And so, the only thing left was Pam, a half-eaten slice of bread, a true veteran of war. To this day he gets flashbacks from Battle of Kitchen Table. As I wasn’t able to eat him, we started talking instead and soon became good friends. Nowadays he’s helping me not to feel guilty over the food I eat. How does he do it? I’ve made him a little throne from some match boxes and he’s just sitting there degrading food on my plate. Just between us, I think he may have had a difficult childhood.\\n\\n“Well, I’m off to work, don’t let the dog eat you.”',\n",

       " '*Berlin, Germany*\\n\\n*5 minutes before the First Silence*\\n\\nKarl was sitting at his desk, procrastinating on starting his latest assignment. He had adapted well to college life; perhaps too well, as he had found himself growing slightly complacent, skipping a few classes (but only the non-important ones), delaying homework (it was easy anyway, 15 minutes at most) and indeed, his lifelong tendency to procrastinate had gotten worse lately.\\n\\nHe was not blind to these attitudes, and they did worry him somewhat, but as long as he wasn\\'t failing was it really that bad? He decided it wasn\\'t, and instead chose to listen to another round of Queen songs. Always a classic.\\n\\n...\\n\\n*Hold on,* he thought, *is Spotify down? That\\'s new.*\\nChecking Twitter to confirm his suspicions, he found the social network inaccessible as well. Not just that, the entire internet had gone out.\\n\\nOh well, it was probably just some problem with the routers in the apartment building. Or something. Karl had never been good with technology. He figured it would be solved by morning, and started work on his assignment. Luckily he wouldn\\'t be needing Wikipedia this time around.\\n\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n*The Pentagon, USA*\\n\\n*5 hours after the First Silence, 43 hours before the Great Hush*\\n\\nJane stood amidst the chaos, not fully comprehending what was happening. She did not know wether she really didn\\'t understand, or if she was simply refusing to accept it.\\n\\n5 hours prior, the internet had gone down. *All* of the internet, from the smallest blog to the most secure of Google servers. It had not come back on since, and confirmation had just arrived that it was neither incompetence on the companies\\' part nor some rogue or foreign-sponsored attack. It had simply happened, and not even the best and brightest of the world\\'s (self-titled) greatest superpower could figure out why.\\n\\nAs her colleagues discussed the next steps, Jane finally grasped the full severity of the situation, and she knew nothing could be done, despite how much she hated that truth. Meetings would be called among the higher echelons, proposals would be approved, further meetings called for. But at the end of the day, they would be lucky if the US lasted a few weeks without mass unrest. Worst case scenario, the country itself may collapse.\\n\\nShe slapped herself, physically to regain her composure and mentally for alllowing panic to get the best of her. The country may collapse? Nonsense. There were still plenty of ways to communicate, backups and redundancies for those, and if push comes to shove, old landlines could be put to use. Plus, without the internet, at least they wouldn\\'t have to worry about hacking attempts.\\n\\nYes, there was nothing to worry about. Well, there was, but it wasn\\'t a complete catastrophe. Manageable at the very least. Calm and collected, Jane resumed her work.\\n\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n*Birobidjan, Russia*\\n\\n*Beginning of the Great Hush*\\n\\nYaroslav had lived in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast his whole life. He was not Jewish, nor were any of his ancestors, but then again neither was the majority of the population. Stalin\\'s little stunt had not been as popular as he had hoped, it seems. Yet somehow, by some twist of fate, Yaroslav still found himself in the minority Ukrainian group within the Oblast. He was not mistreated by any definition of the word, but somehow it still felt odd to him.\\n\\nHe walked towards the old payphones, his few connections to his sister in Moscow. Unlike him, She had always wanted to see the world beyond Siberia and the Steppes, and she had adapted to it well. Yaroslav had always been content in his home, and he did not trust these \"smartphones\" that had gotten so popular in the last decade (though more and more he seemed to be the only one), but he had not objected to let his sister travel and get a \"smartphone\" of her own. On the conditions that she call often, be honest about her experiences, and of course, be careful.\\n\\nAs he reminisced on his sister\\'s departure, he had finally reached his destination. He inserted the coins into the slot, dialed her sister, and...\\n\\nAnd...\\n\\nHuh. This was not the usual tone of the payphone. The usual tone meant his sister would be receiving the call, but he knew this one meant the call had failed to connect. He tried again, but the blasted tone would not go away.\\n\\n*Stupid things. Always breaking.* he lamented, *At least before it was just bad sound. Now I can\\'t even make calls. Maybe I really should have gotten a smartphone.*\\n\\nYaroslav walked away, and prepared to report the broken payphone to the local office of the company. Maybe they\\'d give him another few free calls like last time.\\n\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n*Somewhere in the Amazon Rainforest, Brazil*\\n\\n*30 years into the Great Hush*\\n\\nThe boy had heard his mother speaking of \"the government\" again, and this time he would not give up without answers. He had heard the stories, of the people in the stone forests called \"Cities\", who had given up nature, and possessed great inventions that could do inspiring and awful things. The stories had scared him, until he had grown old enough to see they were very clearly lies. If they had given up nature, how did they eat? How could their inventions be inspiring *and* awful? And how come there was no trace of them?\\n\\nYet this time, his mother did not hush him as usual. She looked deep in thought, then said the boy was ready to know.\\n\\n*To know what?* he had asked, knowing the answer but dreading it all the same.\\n\\n*To know the story of our people, of the City people, and of the Great Hush* she had replied. The exact answer the boy dreaded.\\n\\nShe then spoke of how their people had lived deep in the Rainforest, knowing only nature, until the City people\\'s ancestors arrived. They had been brutes, who conquered all they saw, and enslaved all they met. Then, their own children had driven them away, and over hundreds of years the two peoples had grown closer. Some among the tribes moved to the cities to learn of their people\\'s great inventions, and some among the cities visited the tribes to share gifts and help with hardships.\\n\\nThe City people had been led by a \"government\", which is what they called their leaders, chosen by the people and changing every few years. His mother explained that for a tribe so large, they had to keep traditions like that to prevent corruption and greed, but still could fail to do so, and if that were the case the tribes always suffered. So even though the City people claimed they would let the tribes be, in reality the tribes were dependant on them and their well being.\\n\\nWhich is why all the tribes panicked when the City people stopped coming. For far too long for it to be a simple delay. And when they tried using the talking inventions of the city people, no answer came. Their fears grew; had the City people grown tired of their arrangement? Were they to once again be conquered? Or would they simply be left alone forever?\\n\\nBut one who had left the tribe recognized that the answer was not being denied to us; rather, the City people did not know there was even a question. The talking inventions had broken. All of them. And so we were isolated once more, in what the elders called \"The Great Hush\", for the City people could speak no more.\\n\\nMother had been a small child when it happened. She had never even seen a City person. But as she spoke to the boy, he knew in his heart the story was true. And his heart filled with sorrow for the City people, fear for the future of his people, but oddly, also determination, for he was determined to speak with the City people again and break the Great Hush.\\n\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n*Paris, France*\\n\\n*45 years jnto the Great Hush*\\n\\nJacques took another drag of the cigarette as he looked to the city. Paris, in all it\\'s glory, more so now the world was officially connected again.\\n\\nWell, not exactly. Technically, the new landline into the Americas had been laid, so one could theoretically contact the isolated continents by phone for the first time in decades, but for the foreseeable future such an act would remain a privilege of government officials.\\n\\nThe \"Great Hush\", as it had come to be known after one indigenous amazonian man had made contact with, and convinced, much of the surrounding population to make an effort to contact either Europe or Africa, had been going for 45 years now, and some were starting to give up hope it would ever stop. Decades of progress in telecommunications and wireless transmitions, gone like that. It wasn\\'t the end of the world, for most people anyway (poor bastards on planes, never even saw it coming), and there had been a fair few conflicts in the meantime, but mostly it just meant humanity had to go back to old landlines, even older telegram lines, and good old pen and paper to speak with anyone beyond shouting distance.\\n\\nPerhaps that description did not do it justice. But Jacques did not really care. The details were for historians to remember, the conflicts for generals to get through, the new politics for the new faces promising new lies.\\n\\nAs he contemplated the human condition, human perseverance, and the never ending cycle that is the clusterfuck of politics, Jacques took another drag. He hurried downstairs to make dinner, his boyfriend would be home soon. He didn\\'t know how soon exactly, but he would rather eat slightly cold food than have to wait with Emille for it to be done. That was one thing Jacques wished this new world could have: ways to check for punctuality. Oh well, estimates would have to do for the foreseeable future.',\n",

I\\'m sweating bullets at this point because the fate of the world is in my hands.\\n\\nI\\'m looking down at this small box with only 30 seconds left before it sets off thousands of nuclear bombs hidden underground around the world.\\n\\nThe box contains five wires: red, yellow, blue, green, and orange. My boss is certain that the red wire is the correct one.\\n\\nGripping the pliers, I take one last look at the timer. 22...21...20...19\\n\\nI accidentally grip the pliers a bit too hard and they slide out of my sweaty hands. They tumble onto the linoleum and slide across the floor. \"Shit balls\" I mutter as I jump up to retrieve the pliers. \\n\\n15.. 14....13\\n\\nI grab the pliers off the floor and sprint back over to the box.

Really bad. Now I\\'m seeing 2 sets of the same box. I must\\'ve hit my head harder than I thought. \\n\\n3...2...1\\n\\n\"Fuck it,\" I say, as I clip one of the two red wires that I was seeing. I realize the mistake I\\'ve made when I see that I\\'ve actually clipped off my my pinky finger instead of the wire.\\n\\n0...\"Initiating world elimination sequence\" a robotic voice speaks from the box.\\n\\nI\\'m screaming my head off in pain as large mushroom clouds begin to form in the sky, and move closer to my location.',\n",

I expected a follow-up, but then nothing. 365 days later and I find my door ajar. And the trail of rose petals leads me a bottle of wine. As far as home invasions go this was the most charming. I called the police, but they said an isolated incident like this with nothing stolen was probably a friend or a prank. I laughed, but I knew. I don\\'t have friends. I don\\'t have family.\\n\\n365 days later a parcel waits on my door. I open it to find a hardwood music box. And as I turn the dial I hear tiny motors hum, and then a beat as the lid lifts. Inside lays a small bird\\'s heart wired to a battery and beating at me.\\n\\nI call the police who don\\'t arrive for several hours and when they do they have no idea what to do. I watch them leave knowing they wouldn\\'t be back.\\n\\nI got a dog. This wasn\\'t the fluffy cute kind. This was the eat your face so I can sleep at night kind.\\n\\n300 days later my dog goes missing. Another 65 days and the dog returns. Shaven, decorated and hung in the kitchen like a pinata with his torso torn open. On the plate just off to the side is what I can only describe as canine foie gras. A note awaits me beside the plate, \"You know traditionally the pinata is stuffed with candy, but you\\'re a man. You deserve the decadent and delicious... don\\'t ever let something come between us\".\\n\\n365 days later I can\\'t stomach the smell. I hear the flies inside my house from the drive. But the windows are all covered and the lights are off. As I creak open the door I see decorations. Glitter, streamers, and more. A young girl stood before me.\\n\\n\"You were so lonely... I thought I could be everything you needed, but then you got a dog. I was selfish. You need your friends and family,\" with that the lights came on and I saw the decayed and nearly dead mixed together at my table. My grandmother, mostly bones but for the maggots and worms, was wearing a party hat. To her left was my former college roomie Alan, bleeding from the chest and looking faint with a party whistle taped to his mouth.\\n\\nThe girl grabbed my hand, \"happy birthday, baby,\" she said while pointing the gun at me, \"you should smile... this took a lot of work\".',\n",

I choked back the vomit and hastily prepared food until I choked and passed out.   \\nAs I came out of it the bleach of the hospital smelled angelic.   \\n\\n\\nIt had been a week. I wasn\\'t ready to return home.  \\n358 days later and I\\'m alone in bed. I took the day off of work. The mail came. The clock ticking. I heard wind chimes on the back porch and nothing else.  \\nI had moved, changed my name and got a gun.   \\nMy dogs were much bigger. My property surveilled with cameras. I still got the phantom smells from previous years in my nose. The doctor said it was PTSD, but I swore it was more. I dreamt of the eyes of those living staring at me. And then I woke to know only I lived.   \\nI heard the dogs barking and grabbed my gun. This was it. I was ready. The shot rang off the trees. I watched her stumble. Her lips quiver. Then the fall.  \\nI did not know this woman. It wasn\\'t her.\\n\\nThen I saw the red light in the bushes. And then I heard the rustle. She was gone.  \\nI followed, but on my return, I saw a letter stuck to my door.   \\n\"I can make this go away, or I can not\".\\n\\nI smelled the sauce now. She had ordered takeout.

       " 'Sophie switched on the television, tuned it to the channel she wanted, and waited.\\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of static and noise, she cleared her mind and focused her thoughts, fixing a few images in her mind. Dust and stickiness on the floor. An unused broom and mop.\\n\\nPsychics tended to leave poltergeists behind when they died. Where ghosts were echoes of mind and memory, poltergeists were clusters of emotion, will, and raw psychic power. Which wasn\\'t to say they couldn\\'t learn or think at all.\\n\\nShe\\'d managed to teach this one, after all.\\n\\nThe visual static resolved into a little girl with curly blond hair wearing a blue dress, head lowered so her face couldn\\'t be seen. The background was grainy, but it seemed to show a child\\'s bedroom. The girl was sitting on the bed, kicking her legs the same way Sophie remembered doing when she was little.\\n\\n*what*, the white noise said.\\n\\n\"I noticed you haven\\'t swept or mopped the floors at all this week,\" Sophie said evenly. In her mind she called up the image of the chore chart they\\'d drawn up. \"We both agreed you would do that twice a week—\"  \\n\\nThe little girl hopped off the bed. Her head was still lowered. \\n\\n*no*\\n\\n\"No?\" Sophie asked. The psychic who left this poltergeist behind had been strong-willed, temperamental, and extremely powerful. He had not been a child. And yet his poltergeist always took this form, and she found herself thinking of it as one. \\n\\nOut loud, she said, \"You always seemed to enjoy the exercises I gave you.\"\\n\\nOn the screen, the girl sat down on the floor. She\\'d taken out a doll from somewhere, and was wagging a finger at it.\\n\\n*no fun*\\n\\n\"They\\'re similar, really,\" Sophie said kindly. She thought of the trial and error she\\'d went through communicating with the poltergeist, the pride and happiness she\\'d felt when they\\'d found a way to talk to each other, the cool gentle breezes it would stir up when it managed to refine its telekinetic control or successfully use some other psychic talent.\\n\\nMost psychics had one talent, influenced by innate aptitude and honed to specialty by conscious practice. Poltergeists were potentially capable of them all, but all too often they latched onto telekinesis and then could only express themselves by flinging objects around.\\n\\nThe poltergeist in her family home had come a long way in that respect.\\n\\nThe girl on the screen put down the doll. She still didn\\'t up, but she seemed happier, less sullen.\\n\\n*do now. sorry*\\n\\nThe television switched off. Moments later, the broom and dustpan came floating around the hallway, sweeping by itself.\\n\\nSophie smiled to herself. It was rare for anyone to leave behind both a ghost and a poltergeist, but her father had managed it somehow. He\\'d died alone and bitter, and his ghost had risen the same way. She\\'d had to exorcise it before she could even move in.\\n\\nBut the poltergeist, that combination of his emotion, will, and power... it manifested as what he\\'d had the strongest positive emotional attachment towards when he was alive.\\n\\nEven if she never showed her face, Sophie would know her childhood self anywhere.',\n",

       " 'I stared at the spot of empty space the clerk had disappeared into. Glancing around me, I hoped to spot him. Had it been a trick of the light? Had I just missed him stepping around me? But no, there was no one in sight. It was just me and the lemonade stand.\\n\\nHesitantly, I stepped forward, sticking my hand into the spot the clerk had walked into. My hand passed through the air. Nothing happened. I had just wanted some lemonade. Was I going crazy?\\n\\nA severed arm popped into existence before me and grabbed the collar of my shirt. I was pulled off my feet and fell forward. There was a disorienting feeling and I felt like I was floating with no way of knowing which way was up. I heard a muffled voice and blinked to clear my blurry vision.\\n\\nThe clerk was standing before me and saying something, though I could not make out the words. My ears had popped. He gestured behind him and drew my attention to the fact that I was no longer on a sidewalk near my home. I did not know where I was.\\n\\nWe stood in a cavernous… well, cavern. It was narrow enough around me but widened without end soon after. There was an endless void as whatever light allowed me to see failed to reach the depths of the cavern. I couldn’t see anything there, but I could not shake the feeling that I was being watched.\\n\\nForcing a yawn through my ears, I looked back at the clerk.\\n\\n“Well, I hope you’re happy. You’re going to get us both in trouble. If the stand said you weren’t thirsty, then you weren’t thirsty! I can’t force it to serve you. That’s just the policy.” He shook his head at me. “Well, it’s too late to regret it now. I called the regional manager over.”\\n\\n“I don’t regret anything,” I said, fighting to keep my voice from cracking. “If you refuse to serve me, then I demand better service. How ridiculous. A store that decides whether its customers actually want their merchandise instead of the other way around.”\\n\\n“I’m going to get written up. That’s the third time this decade,” the clearly teenage looking clerk said with a sigh.\\n\\nThe dark void of the distance seemed to shake and parted as though it were a curtain. No light beamed through it, piercing the darkness. It was simply as though the space itself was moved aside, revealing the towering figure sitting behind it.\\n\\nHe sat on a stone throne, so large it was more a mountain that served a convenient purpose as a seat than it was a piece of furniture itself. The man upon it was even larger. He reminded me of the cartoons I had seen as a child, where adults were so much bigger than the child characters that their heads would be cut off by the edge of the television screen. For his figure stretched so tall that I could not make out his face. Before such a being, what was I but a child.\\n\\nBut a child could still be a customer. And the customer, as I knew, was always right.\\n\\n“What seems to be the problem?” the manager’s voice spoke to my mind.\\n\\n“I…” I couldn’t help but fall silent before his presence. This being commanded greater authority than I had ever faced in my entire life. His very existence cowed my own. But I had to persevere, for customers everywhere. “I am being denied service. It is not right.”\\n\\n“I am told that the stand determined you to not be thirsty. That is how it works. If you were truly thirsty, lemonade would have been displayed before you, there for the picking. But you were not, and so you have no avenue for complaint.”\\n\\n“That’s ridiculous! I am thirsty. How can you deny my own claim about my own condition? I just walked for an hour in the sun. I’m parched. Why should that pile of driftwood have any say over what I can and cannot buy?” I said, my voice rising and becoming more confident as I continued to speak my mind.\\n\\n“I am the one who made that stand. Do you claim that your judgment is better than my own?” he said in a warning tone. How dare a mere store manager threaten a customer?\\n\\n“I do. No one can speak for me except me,” I said.\\n\\n“Then quench your thirst.”\\n\\nI was lost in that feeling of disorientation once more. I was floating with no sense of direction. As my vision cleared again, I was seized by a feeling of panic. It was not just a feeling this time, I really was floating. I was in the depths of a sea, lost beneath the surface. As I flailed and accidentally swallowed some of the liquid, I tasted a familiar bittersweet flavor. I had been left to drown in an ocean of lemonade.\\n\\nThe primal fear of death weighed on my mind. I had no time to think. I picked a direction and swam towards it. I needed air. Every swing of my arms, every push of my legs, the ocean pulled my strength from my limbs. A pressure built up in my chest. I needed air. The mouth shook, demanding to open, to exhale, to inhale. I needed air. My vision dimmed, narrowing to a pinpoint. I needed air.\\n\\nI stopped moving, simply lost in the motion of floating. I was floating. I was floating. I was falling.\\n\\nI collapsed onto the sidewalk, drenched in my sweat instead of lemonade. I desperately took in a breath. The sweet rush of air woke my mind once more. I struggled to take in my surroundings. I was on the same sidewalk I had been on before. Beside me was an empty lemonade stand. There was no clerk, no godly being. Had I imagined it? Experienced a heat stroke in my poor attempt at exercise?\\n\\nBut no, the lemonade stand wasn’t empty. There was a small card standing on its surface. ‘We hope you enjoyed our service,’ it read. It had been real! And I was still thirsty.\\n\\nr/Inder',\n",
       " '\"I want to speak to the manager!\" I very nearly yell at the useless, bumbling store employee. Honestly, why do they hire people who can\\'t even do their jobs properly?\\n\\nThe idiot employee\\'s eyebrows shot up like they were trying to jump off his face. \"Right this way,\" he says, and although he tries to sound calm, his voice is shaking. And rightfully so. After I\\'m through with my chat with the manager, that incompetent waste of space is going to be fired and he\\'s never going to work retail again.\\n\\nHe leads me to the back room, which is a bit strange. I\\'ve never been in the back before. He opens a nondescript door and enters the room behind.\\n\\nDarkness. The first thing that registers is darkness. Soul-crushing, breath-stealing darkness.\\n\\nThen the lights flick on. I take in... more darkness?\\n\\nThat\\'s when I realize to look up. It\\'s not more darkness, but the shadows of two huge thrones. One of them is white with beautiful spirals of gold inset on engravings swirling across the entire thing. It radiates happiness, peace, harmony, all that. Some of the engravings are just those words written in a fancy script and cleverly hidden within the design.\\n\\nThe other, right next to it, is dominating. It\\'s made of the darkest stone I\\'ve ever seen, and seems to suck in all the light around it because I can\\'t see a single spark. Instead of gold, there are threatening patterns made of thin red lines, and it seems that something inside of the throne is burning, because the color of the lines is moving.\\n\\nOnly the black throne is occupied. I look up even farther and take in the identity of who I\\'m seeing. He looks normal at first, aside from the gigantic size, but some features just don\\'t register in my mind for the first few seconds.\\n\\nThen it clicks.\\n\\n\"Oh. My. *Fucking*. God.\"\\n\\n\"Actually, it\\'s Satan!\"',\n",

       " \"  \\\\[SO yeah… I took some liberties with what you intended the prompt to incite (or so I assume), sorry if this isn’t what you wanted.\\\\] \\n\\nWhen I first met them, their eyes were a deep scarlet, they introduced themselves as Rose. Rose and I spoke for a long time about our hobbies, or passions as she called them. She seemed unimpressed when I told her my passion for movies and quickly flared up angerly telling me how tame a passion that it was as she told me about her pursuit for love and someone who can put up with her. I was confused by this as she seemed nice enough if a little too intense at times, but brushed it off and quickly asked her to meet up again. Same place, same time.\\n\\nThe next time we met her eyes were orange. I called her by the name she had given me yesterday, and she laughed. Stopped laughing. Then laughed again. This time she introduced herself as Aurora, her personality seemed slightly different, she had the same energy of Rose but seemed to be more fascinated in everyone else, unlike Rose who by her own admission prioritized herself. The more we talked the more of a difference I saw – for one she even ordered a completely different drink she claimed her favorite drink, Rose had a completely different favorite. We talked about similar topics however, like what we had attractions towards. Again, I said movies expecting to be chewed out again but to my surprise she enthusiastically nodded her head and began to launch into the recent successes of the current blockbusters. As the café began to close, we said our goodbyes and promised to meet up again. Same place, same time.\\n\\nWe found each other again at the same café on the corner. This time the girl’s eyes were yellow and she introduced herself as Daisy. Daisy was sweet, almost as much as her drink, and she was full of energy and always flashed a smile or laughed about whatever we talked about, the newest funniest clips on Youtube or the brilliant movie just released. Daisy opened up more about her situation than the others and explained to me about the other personalities, and that I should be careful of one in particular although she didn’t mention which one. Again, the café began to close and we made the same promise to meet. Same place, same time.\\n\\nThis time I was late to the café and before I could fumble out an excuse, I was assaulted with accusations that sounded almost Jealous, was this the one I was to be careful of? Or so I thought but this new personality gasped and apologized before it got out of hand and introduced herself as Evanlyn who’s eyes were a deep canopy green. Our conversation quickly turned pleasant. We talked about our ambitions and I explained that I wanted to create things for people to enjoy like a movie or something of the like, and she talked about her wish to eventually own a store like this one. I made a joke about free coffee if she did and as we parted ways, we made the promise again. Same place, same time.\\n\\nAt the same place at the same time I met her again, this time her eyes were blue and she introduced herself as Alyss. This time she was cool, calm and confident. We done the re-introductions I was used to at this point but unlike normal she led the conversation the depth she would go into about her topics and any I brought up made me a bit dizzy. However, like usual when the café closed and we parted ways we promised to meet again. Same place, same time. \\n\\nThis time I was greeted by a girl with indigo eyes who introduced herself as Indy. This time our conversation was deep and insightful but as time grew short as she explained to me that the next time, we met I needed to be careful. I was told that the last personality was one they weren’t proud of and that she didn’t want another person to leave them again and that I needed to be careful as to not be discouraged from coming to see her. So again, I made the promise. Same Place, same time.\\n\\nThe day came and I was sitting nervously at the café, on my own. Time passed slowly as I nursed my coffee. I waited and I waited. Then the door opened and a stranger with a familiar face stalked across the room. Black eyes met mine as she dropped into her seat across for me. She ordered a coffee and snapped her name at me, she was called Ciara. She spoke very little and brooded over her drink; despite my best efforts at striking up a conversation I only got short, harsh, and rather rude answers. Near the end of the day she spoke to me her voice sharp and began to insult my intelligence for meeting her and how I’d hate her now how everyone stopped meeting them after meeting her but she couldn't help herself. I smiled and made the same promise I always did.\\n\\nSame place, same time.\",\n",
       " '  \\\\[So, as I said at the start I took some liberties with what you meant as Dangerous and decided that a dangerous personality would be one that is self-destructive to relationships formed by the other personalities, and imagined that they thought the last personality was dangerous because the remaining personalities never saw the person they met who finally met the “Dangerous” personality again\\\\]',\n",

A strange, purple smoke billowed out of it, spreading out on the ceiling like a strange grouping of clouds. \"We mean to *please* our guest, not send him to another dimension!\"\\n\\nThe alchemist smiled, a sly smirk brimming with confidence. To win this round, all she had to do was something simple, something average, and almost by default she\\'d get a point. They\\'d long been in competition, trying a variety of strange mixtures and concoctions - or meals, in the case of the chef - in an effort to make something marketable to the buying public. And, of course, to better humanity, a fortunate byproduct of their creations, if and when they did succeed. Until then, she took every opportunity to rile up the chef. \"There he stands, a jealous man, can\\'t even make a simple flan.\"\\n\\nThe chef stood up suddenly, irate at the accusation. \"How dare you? My flan is a masterpiece!\"\\n\\n\"On your flan my opinion is split, whether it tastes like trash or it tastes like-\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s enough!\" the guest interjected. \"I\\'m invited here to judge your competition. I\\'m not here to listen to petty insults. You!\" He pointed to the chef. \"You\\'re a hobbyist, at best, so take off that foolish chef\\'s hat. You\\'re bald, damn it! Your hair has already fallen out on the ground, not the food!\" The \\'chef\\' sheepishly removed his hat. \"And you,\" pointing to the alchemist. \"You mix a bunch of nonsense in a pot and pour it down my throat. You\\'re not some dark wizard speaking in riddles. Quit being so smug.\" The alchemist lowered her head. While their guest owed them his life - in a way - they were wrong to antagonise him so. They knew he didn\\'t like their fighting.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry about our little skirmishes,\" the alchemist said quietly, \"I\\'ll try to stop the... it\\'s not the way of...\"\\n\\n\"Spoke yourself into a corner with \\'skirmishes\\', didn\\'t you?\" the guest asked. \"Now pass your creation.\" She nodded and handed over the flask of bubbling green goo with her head hung low. \"Shall we give this a try, if we\\'re done babbling?\"\\n\\nThe two competitors nodded and said their thanks. Their guest tipped the flask over and watched as it flowed slowly across the table. The purple mist billowed from each drop exposed to the air. The room suddenly smelled like feet, and the chef had to bite his tongue and resist taunting the now blushing alchemist. Their guest licked the liquid from the table, remarkably dignified considering the action. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, the belly of their guest started to expand, looking as if it could burst so large it became. The gas inside him was so light it lifted him from the very ground, and he began floating around the room, bouncing gently off the roof and walls.\\n\\n\"I believe it\\'s safe to say it\\'s time to administer the time-slip,\" the guest said in a dry tone.\\n\\nThe alchemist shot a glance at the chef after she provided the necessary drink to bring him back down to the floor and return to normalcy. Her smirk had disappeared entirely. \"I would hope that you would cease to gloat, about our friend that had begun to float.\"\\n\\nWhen the guest returned to the ground, he looked his two companions in the eye, one after another. His head drooped from fatigue. Being the test subject was never an easy role. \"Listen,\" he began, \"I believe I must be close to paying off my... debt of thanks. I can\\'t do this much longer.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, surely not,\" the chef said. \"Dare I remind you where you came from?\"\\n\\nThe alchemist nodded her agreement. \"We took you from a hole in the floor, while most would send you to death\\'s door.\"\\n\\nHe looked down to the ground. He saw the hole they spoke of. Years ago that had been his home. Instead of sending him out, the alchemist gave him a potion. Miraculously it gave him, a lowly rat, a brilliant mind and the ability to speak their language. The thought of returning to that life, so undignified and wretched... the debt was a large one indeed. In the meantime he hoped the chef would learn how to cook.\\n\\n\"Why a rat, anyway?\" the guest asked. \"There are plenty of animals you could have chosen.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re the one we thought to bring,\" the alchemist began. The chef smiled and decided to finish the rhyme for her. \\n\\n\"Because a rat will eat just anything.\"\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nThanks for reading!

       " '\"Sit, boy, sit!\" The Head Chef of The Staggered Beetle called from the back of house.\\n\\nIt was sunup. I had barely slept- up all night crawling through a goblin cave. Barely stringing coherent thoughts together.\\n\\nAn hour previous, as I had just drifted off to sleep, a messenger pounded on my Adventurer\\'s dormitory door- much to the annoyance of all my dorm mates. \"Come to the Staggered Beetle,\" he said. He was going to say more, but I already knew. The Head Chef had some new experiment he wanted me to try.\\n\\nWell- at least when the Chef botched a dish, it was far better for consuming than the failed concoctions of the Alchemist.\\n\\nI sat at a table with my head in my hands, fighting back Hypnos\\'s sleepy embrace. \\n\\nThe Head Chef peeked out from the back of house. \"Sleepy, eh? I have *just* the thing- I\\'ve been working on it ever since...the Alchemist... gave you that health potion that seals wounds. This here could revive a corpse that\\'s been dead for a week! Hah!\" The Chef cracked his familiar smile, then disappeared into the back of the house once more- emerging for the final time, now with a steaming bowl and a frosty cold glass.\\n\\n\"In the bowl, I have something to restore your lost energy in a more gradual, natural way.\" He pulled the stone lid off of the bowl and a billow of delightfully scented steam rose. It was rich- a sharp, strong cheese, followed by the savory scent of roasted potatoes, onion, tomatoes, and the most incredible sausage, all chopped finely and mixed inside.\\n\\nSaliva pooled in my mouth in anticipation, and I took the bowl gratefully, shoveling as much inside my mouth at a time as I could. The scent may have been delicious- but the taste had hidden entire layers that the scent didn\\'t carry. The earthy undertones of the vegetables were the first tasting note- then the savory combination of the pork sausage and the strong, aged cheddar- this was...\\n\"Your finest creation to date!\" I mumbled through massive mouthfuls, managing minimal moments lost with the stew.\\n\\nThe Chef beamed with pride, and I thought I saw the hint of a tear form at the corner of his eye. Wouldn\\'t surprise me overly much- he had always been a sensitive type.\\n\\n\"Now,\" He said, as I finished the stew. \"This here is for when you want for energy. I know you just spent the night plying your...trade... but you have an exam at midday! If you can\\'t catch up on sleep before then, this\\'ll fix you right up! Do you want it now, or later?\"\\n\\n\"Um...what is it?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Hah! You\\'ll find out. Here.\" He said, filling a tall metal cylinder with the contents of the glass, then corking it. \"Good luck today, boy.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t need luck, Chef. Especially not with you and...the other one doting on me.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t speak to me of the Alchemist. You know I don\\'t approve of...all of that.\"\\n\\n\"Fair enough.\" I said, waving on my way out from the restaurant.\\n\\nI returned to my dorm, but I knew sleep would not come for me again. I had a weird relationship with it, it seemed- if I turned down sleep\\'s advances once, it would come back with a vengeance. If I turned it down twice... it would give me the cold shoulder for another full day before deigning to darken my door again.\\n\\nWell- that, and I knew as soon as the Alchemist heard that I had tasted a new concoction of the Chef...\\n\\n*Knock knock knock*\\n\\nI opened the door, my boots still on. The messenger on the other side prepared to speak, but I cut him off. \"Already on it, thanks.\"\\n\\nI walked out onto the cobblestone streets- the sun was beginning to burn off the early-morning dew. The streets were just beginning to hum with energy and activity- almost like an orchestra in the Artists Mausoleum when they tuned their instruments. It was a very pleasant feeling- though, perhaps this was colored by the rush of endorphins from the Chef\\'s superb stew, still settling into my stomach.\\n\\nI walked a leisurely pace towards the Apothecary. I knew she was anxious to see me- but it would\\'ve been a shame to upset my stomach just now.\\n\\nFinally reaching her door, I knocked three times...and I waited...and three more times, before I just invited myself in. Luckily, I was no vampire, elseways I\\'d never actually *see* the Alchemist. A true sweetheart, she was- but scatterbrained as well.\\n\\n\"Hello?\" I called out, walking through the assorted oddments and instruments associated with scientific and magical processes that were so foreign to me.\\n\\n\"AH!\" The Alchemist came around a corner- her graying hair was all standing straight up. \"M\\'boy, m\\'boy, I\\'ve had a discovery! Sorry- I know I sent for you, I was going to get you to try this Mugwart potion, to help you sleep, you see- but this is better! I am convinced I\\'ve found a way to make magical energy *consumable!*\"\\n\\nMy eyes went as wide as my will would allow them. \"That...that would be insane! That\\'s revolutionary! Have you tried it?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"No, no, can you imagine *me* with magical power?\" She cackled. \"I\\'d be just as likely to set this whole place on fire as actually do something productive with it! No, I\\'m giving it to you, for your exam today. It\\'s not against the rules, I checked- well, they couldn\\'t forbid something that doesn\\'t exist, could they? Hah! With this, you\\'ll gain temporary access to the abilities the Mages neglect and ignore...Increased reflexes, the ability to manipulate things around you- I\\'m not sure exactly what it\\'ll entail, but it is all perfectly safe, the ingredients are surprisingly mundane. This will give you an *oomph* that\\'ll blow your examiners out of the water.\"\\n\\nI pulled the Alchemist into a hug. \"Bless you, Mum.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, well...\" She said, a little frazzled by the contact. \"I had to out do your father, didn\\'t I? I assume he gave you some vegetable stock and sent you on your way...\" She sniffed indignantly.\\n\\n\"No, he made me this most amazing stew- tomatoes, sharp cheddar, sausage crumble- look, mum, there\\'s really no need for you two to keep fighting. He\\'s accepted that I\\'m an adventurer now- and both of you are supporting me in it. You don\\'t need to fight.\"\\n\\n\"I know, I know...we just- we said some hurtful things, when we first argued about it. And now I don\\'t know if we can ever...unsay what we said.\"\\n\\n\"Well. I\\'m an adventurer now- hell, I\\'ll be a Hero, after this exam. If a Hero can\\'t make two lovely people be amendable to each other, then what good is he? I\\'m not asking you to get re-married...just to be able to be across a dinner table from one another twice a year. I\\'ve got some monsters to slay- and I want you there. I want both of you there. At noon, I\\'ll see you both in the stands.\"\\n\\nI left then, and hired a messenger to tell my Dad to be in attendance for my exam. I would show them that the combination of their gifts- the two of them keeping me in perfect health, with boosted stamina and now the gift of magic- I was going to absolutely *crush* these exams, and show them that together, they achieved something truly miraculous.',\n",

       " 'I walked into the home of my latest appointment and slipped off my shoes at the front door. A frantic old woman, her hands bent with time grasping one another in a desperate attempt to remain calm. I figured it was fear, like most of my clientele, but as I studied her face, I recognized a burning anger seething in her light blue eyes.\\n\\n“I loved Gilbert very much,” she began. “I was very sad when he passed a few weeks ago.” She led me through the home, past the quaint sitting room in the front and the living room at the heart of the ranch, as she headed to the source of the haunting. Her bedroom.\\n\\n“I was initially surprised when I realized his spirit hadn’t quite left this world,” she said, pushing the door to her bedroom open. The pungent smell of lavender, what I guessed was her perfume, wafted through the doorway.\\n\\n“I was happy for a couple days, it was nice to chat with him again,” she said. “But it seems that his spirit is much more *rambunctious* than I was anticipating. He’s already shattered one of my mirrors and broken half the vases in the house, and I’m at my wits end. I said my peace to him long ago when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and quite frankly I just want to spend however many days I have left in peace. Not attempting to wrangle a ghostly toddler.” She shot an annoyed glance at the top of the wardrobe shoved in the corner of the room. I glanced over and noticed a ghostly presence sitting atop the piece of furniture, his legs kicking absentmindedly over the edge as he lazily tossed a vase in the air.\\n\\n“Hey sweet cheeks,” he said, his wicked smile letting loose a plume of ghostly fog that quickly dissipated. His voice was ethereal and halting, common for ghosts that were fighting to be pulled into the next plane. He battled against the natural progression of a spirit to the underworld, and so his hold on this world was tentative at best.\\n\\n“Gilbert, for the twentieth time, would you stop taking my vases before they…” she was cut off by the sound of her vase crashing to the floor, shattering into tens of pieces. She smacked her face to her forehead and groaned. “See, this is why he needs to go. He’s lost any care of manners and has left me to deal with the mess.”\\n\\n“Yes ma’am I can certainly see that,” I said. “Would you give me a few minutes alone with Gilbert? I think I know what will help in this situation. Did you need to say goodbye before you go?”\\n\\n“Certainly not, I said those when I believed he was actually leaving me for good,” she huffed. “Besides, this mischievous ghost isn’t really my husband, just a cheap echo.” I nodded, surprised she understood so much of the spirits of the dead, and watched as she slowly made her way to the bedroom’s exit. She shot Gilbert’s spirit a last, pained expression before snapping the door closed, clearly saying goodbye in her own way without the fanfare of it.\\n\\n“Alright Gilbert,” I said, plopping down on the bed. “I’ll give you this one warning. I’m the nice guy they send in before shit goes south.”\\n\\n“Watch your language young man,” said the ghost, grinning wickedly. “Ah nevermind, I don’t give a fuck, just joking with you.”\\n\\n“Clearly,” I said flatly. “Look, you can either leave today and it’ll be a nice, peaceful passing to the underworld. You’ll even get to make as much mischief down there that you want. The other option is you don’t leave, I call up my boss the Reaper, and you can leave in the most painful way possible. He will forcefully rip your soul from this world, drag you to the underworld, and you will serve a sentence of a lifetime of torture.” I looked at my nails, observing the need to trim them slightly. “Like I said, your choice, but I would advise the former.” I looked up and noticed Gilbert was visibly shaken by my warning.\\n\\n“Fine, have it your way, I was getting bored here with the old lady anyways,” said Gilbert. His form began to shimmer and fade as he slowly severed his connection to this world. He gave me a wink and flashed a grin with the last of his presence before he disappeared.\\n\\n“Thank god I didn’t have to call Reaper for this one, he would have been pissed at me interrupting his football match,” I said as I pulled a notebook from my pocket and struck Gilbert’s name from the list.',\n",

       " '“Yeah. It isn’t the worst kind of feeling. I just never really aged. Hit like 37 or somewhere around that and never grew a day older.” I said taking a sip of my coffee. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, does it get lonely?” The man sitting at the table across from me said as he looked on in wonder. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Sometimes. You sort of learn to enjoy the quiet times. Create your own hobbies, learn a new language, fishing, dancing. Really whatever comes to you. You have all the time in the world. If you don’t, you go insane really!” I said smiling. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe man looked around before leaning in towards me. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What about the relationships. Must be weird meeting someone thousands of years younger then you. How do you explain it to them?” \\r\\n\\r\\nI took another sip of coffee before clearing my throat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Every day I wonder, ‘what would it be like if this person was also immortal? Would they be happy to stay with me?’ I always remember who I spent a lifetime with. Hundreds of women and men I’ve met and formed lifelong partnerships with. Families started and blossoming to this day. When my partner dies its always weird seeing the children and sometimes grandchildren that look older then me. I just usually leave them and start anew.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you ever contemplate…you know?” he said as he made a gesture of his thumb going across his neck. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Haha. You mean suicide? I never understood the negative connotation with the word. Could be because I live forever so there is no such thing as the feeling of a wasted life. I thought about it, but there’s still so much left to do. So many things left to see.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind picked up as the sun was starting to approach the edge of the mountains off in the distance. \\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you remember about your childhood?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked up from my cup and pondered for a second. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I remember being a child in a small village of hunters. We were originally from Peru. Norte Chico civilization. Eventually just outlived everyone and met the Spanish. Survived that and made it to modern history.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What was it like back then?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“Very humdrum. Boring as can be. Nothing like how life was like 150 years ago to the present day. Exciting times we live in eh?” I said trying to illicit a response from the man asking questions. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah seems to be. What about your health? Physically and mentally? You feel more or less the same throughout your life?” \\r\\n\\r\\n“With the exception of smoking probably wreaking havoc on my lungs, physically fit as a horse. A doctor a while back said I might have signs of schizophrenia. I told him you can study me for however many years you want to. He gave me some pills but I forgot where they were and I’m doing fine without them so I think he might have just been a bit too eager is all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fascinating. You know you’re really an interesting person to talk to.” The man said as leaned back in his seat. \\r\\n\\r\\nI beamed a smile to his expressionless face. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Thanks. Not often I get to speak to people these days. What with all the conflict and turmoil going on around us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I hope that you take care of yourself. Quit smoking if you can. Maybe take those pills the doctor said. Mental health is just as important as physical health.” He said as he stood up from his chair. \\r\\n\\r\\nI stood up as well and stretched my arms. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Getting late. Suns starting to give us last call. Where you heading, friend?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You tell me. Its your decision anyway.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe man had vanished as I looked around and noticed the pile of sticks and leaves on the chair where the man was previously sitting, the table that was covered in soot and dust, and the nearly totaled buildings around me. The cup I had been sipping on was cracked in half and moldy. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn a moment of lucidity I observed my surroundings and brushed the dust off my pants. \\r\\n\\r\\n“The war certainly took its toll on humanity. Maybe I do need to find some of those pills the doctor said.”',\n",
       " 'Short story/monologue \\n\\n“It gets lonely, but immortality isn’t so bad”\\n\\nThe key is to not get attached, thats where all the other suckers get it wrong. you have a  few days or weeks of fun and then you get out. Sure you make some enemies and break hearts but they will be dead soon enough so whats the harm right?  I mean I’ve been alone for 700 years but my bed hasn’t been empty for most of that.  Shit 700 years has it really been that long.... huh.  Sure I run into the occasional other like me, I can always tell, it’s a look in their eyes, one that says that they have lived for too long. Of course I don’t have that look, hell some of them have even tried to seduce me but thats my one rule ‘DON’T SLEEP WITH OTHER IMMORTALS!’  It just gets messy and its not like you can kill them if they get too annoying, sure they may dematerialize for a day or too but then you have them hunting you for years and it is such a drag. just trust me don’t. So yeah I guess immortality can be lonely but if you don’t look at it like that it isn’t so bad.',\n",

       " 'Flying though wilting buttercups and daffodils, worker bee Praxis scavenged for supplies. She pressed hard to keep aloft as snowflakes battered against her small frame.

She clicked her mandibles, locating a honey well at last. \\n\\nDescending onto the petals, she extended her proboscis and began feeding.

He did not stay to continue a conversation.\\n\\nHeaded back to his hive, she noticed a nearby oak tree calling out to her.',\n",
       " \" \\n\\nIt was the middle of spring, and the flowers were all blooming. While this may come as a pretty sight to most, it comes to us, ‘The LetterBees” as a lot of food and a lot of work. We don’t just beat our wings and collect honey, we relay messages for the plant kingdom through their pollen. The pollen doesn’t just stick to us all the time, some of them have been kept there to act as a letter or a mode of communication from one plant to another. It is my duty as a LetterBee, to make sure that the plants get to communicate, we don’t charge much..just a LOT of nectar.\\n\\nThe tulips were closing and the fireflies were shining their lights, the moonlight fell on the green clearing right below the hive, the Queen had gone in for the night and the letterbees were out celebrating their good day’s work. Spring was a busy time, and the plants were getting chatty enough for the LetterBees to score some extra nectar which they had brought out tonight to enjoy. The oldest of them, wise ol’ *Apes,* drunk on the sweet golden ambrosia started to recollect the days of his past...back when the LetterBees were few and the founder still flew…\\n\\nBees hear this story growing up, of Barry Benson the founder of the letterbees and the heroic tale of how he saved the forest. It was years back, the forest was shrouded in an ominous light. The light rustle of the leaves which had once heralded flashing lights and brought traces of sweet smells in the air, now sounded ghastly and haunted enough to dim the strong thrum of the Bees. They were on their usual rounds, collecting nectar mindful of the Queen’s wistful mood. These were the times the Bees were unaware of the plant’s intelligence and as such their plight. Barry was about done sucking the only lavender flower he was able to find that day when he started to hear whispers, they came faint and tired at first but then rose in volume and urgency so fast he feared that a storm had broken out. He flew around trying to find the source of these whispers and it led him straight to the great Oaks, majestic things that looked bleak now in the eerie colourless atmosphere. He started when he heard disconnected phrases “*heelppp…….the virus spreads…...honey, remedy….”* coming from the trees, and these were hard enough to make out from what now appeared to Barry as the Oak’s rough musky wheezes(pollen allergies perhaps?). Barry was at a loss as he never could’ve expected the plants that he had surrounded himself had now proven to be sentient and capable of talking. Barry’s sense of duty recognized the plea in the Oak’s voice and with haste investigated what the problem was. There were yellow tendrils climbing up from the ground and up the Oak trees’ bark. At that moment, Barry knew what he had to do and went to get help from his closest friends from the nectar collection squad he had left behind. They decrypted the phrases to mean that honey was to be spread on the yellow patches to cure the Oaks. IT WORKED! The Bees began to work with prompt and spread the honey all over the tree. The Oaks were grateful to the bees and entrusted them with the job to act as messengers in the plant kingdom. There began the tales of the LetterBees...  \\n\\n\\n\\\\------  \\nThis is the first story I've written in this subreddit and I'd appreciate any criticism. DON'T HOLD BACK, I can take it. I got hasty towards the end, pardon me for that :3\",\n",

       " 'The candle flame turned blue as I began to read from the dusty, leather-backed tome. \\n\\nA pale blue ghost clung, horizontally, to the wooden doorframe as a swirling black hole opened, sucking the ethereal haunter out of this world. For far too long, I was plagued with this spirit. \\n\\nIt let out an ear-shattering scream. \"NOOOOOOOOOO. You can\\'t banish me.\" The doorframe collapsed into splintering wooden shards. The ghost disappeared through the portal. \"Fool,\" the former soul called back to me from the other side, \"I was trying to protect youuuuuuuuuuuuu!\" \\n\\nI could live my life in peace, now. Finally, I could get things done. \\n\\nTwo weeks later, the doorframe still sat in pieces, scattered across my bedroom floor. I stepped over them towards the bathroom to take a piss. I looked down at the toilet. \"Oh, still clogged.\" The sink works just as well. \\n\\nGrabbing a beer from the delivered 24-pack becoming warm in the midday heat, I winced at the sunlight. Going back inside, I climbed over the piles of black trash bags that slowly dissolved into un-bagged mountains of filth. Back at my desk, I continued to play Ghost Zapper 4 on my desktop PC, until the game crashed. \\n\\n\"Oh, look at that.\" As the screen returned to the desktop for the first time in half a month, I found the \\'To Do\\' list I had left my self from before the ghost exorcism. \\n\\nMy eyes began scrolling down the list of tasks, ranging from \"Daily: Dishes\", to \"Work project: Report on income statements,\" and ending in \"Find true love!!!\" \\n\\n\"Oh.\" I said to myself. \"I guess that\\'s what the ghost meant.\" I paused thinking what to do next. \\n\\n\"Well, whatever.\" I deleted the digital sticky notes and went back to my game.',\n",
       " '\"Right there. 1500 Baht per month.\" I pointed my finger to the map on my laptop screen. It was the location of a house for rent around my office in Sukhumvit. \"Looks very good and clean too.\"\\n\\nWell, it was my greatest regret in my life living there.\\n\\nI was bothered by the \"poltergeist\" in my house. Things moved around behind me, curtain closed itself, sometimes it turned off the light all of a sudden. Sure it\\'s powerful.\\n\\nI tried to send emails, messages, even a dozen letters to the famous TV show \"Ghost Reliever\", but all of them went silent.\\n\\nAfter 2 weeks of waiting, they reached out to me, offering the relieve after I tell them my story at the studio.\\n\\nI got there, told the rest of it, got along with their script, and called it a day.\\n\\n\"No.\" The famous guy of the show, Dew the Whisperer told me after the shooting. \"Your case is... special. I think I\\'m not done yet.\"\\n\\nWith sheer luck, he offered to drive me home and I accepted, but why did he do that?\\n\\nAfter parking the car and having a dinner at the a-la-carte, Dew got back to it, opened the trunk and grabbed a big box, labeled \"Ritual Equipments\".\\n\\n\"We\\'ll try to reach her and talk. If she resist, we have no choice.\" He said before going to the living room together.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll prepare the site. You wrap the holy thread around it.\" I caught the white yarn he threw and unrolled it while he placed a brass vessel and filled them with the \"seven-blessings\" holy water.\\n\\nAfter the site was done, I sat down. Before me were a bundle of a lotus, a yellow candle and an incense. A little further was a sheet of paper with the \"Soul Banisher\" chanting.\\n\\n\"Grab the bundle, make a prayer\\'s hand and say the following. Word. By. Word.\" I nodded to him as a signal, as I did as he said.\\n\\n\"I, Dew the Whisperer/Jaroenchai Aon-waan, would like to communicate with you. If you hear me, please send me a signal.\" We took turn saying it. He was calm, but I shut my eyelids tight in fear.\\n\\n\"Here she comes.\" I opened my eyes, and meet the ghost. She\\'s beautiful, with no wounds whatsoever. The room felt like it\\'s shaking. Lights flickered in an erratic pattern.\\n\\nHe asked \"What are your regrets?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t tell you about that. No.\"\\n\\n\"Wh-why did you do those lights and things? Is it for your... desire?\"\\n\\n\"Not a prank, but still, I can\\'t talk about that. If you know them, you\\'ll get killed, both.\"\\n\\n\"No one knows if you tell us about that. You\\'re a ghost, after all.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not telling anything.\"\\n\\nSuddenly, he mumbled the chant, setting her ethereal body in a corroding aura.\\n\\n\"Ahhhhh!\" She screamed painfully, making everything to shake harder. \"I was doing it all for you! How dare you do this!\"\\n\\n\"Sorry, girl. W-we need the truth and you should... say it now before getting banished.\" I turned to ask him. \"If she\\'s not dead, where would she go?\"\\n\\n\"Back into their bodies.\" Interrupted by my question,  Dew stared at me and shook his head. He continued the chant.\\n\\n\"No. I don\\'t want to be back. Please.\" The girl is now on her knees, begging us.\\n\\n\"Then please tell me everything. We\\'re involved in this now.\"\\n\\n\"All of them. I was protecting you from the debt takers. They don\\'t know I\\'m in comatose for half a year. If they sees you in here, they\\'ll assume you are my friends and...\"\\n\\n\"Done.\" Dew was exhausted. Everything calmed down. The sheet has the message from her handwriting: \\'142, Female Ward, Bumrung Medical Hospital.\\'\\n\\nAnd she\\'s gone.\\n\\nThen, the door broke down, and a bunch of drugged thugs are aiming anything that can kill at us.\\n\\nWe have to run.\\n\\n_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_\\n\\nI woke up so sudden my heart almost skipped. \\n\\nIn my ward, the only one who still be with me is sleeping soundly.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry mom.

       " 'The following is an excerpt from an autobiography, never written:\\n\\nRemember that it is imperative you approach the world with an open mind. It is not what you think, nor is it what you know. To measure reality, society or anything exactly is to draw perfectly the coast of an island. Ever moving grains of sand, infinite fractals of the edges and so on. I repeat it is not what you think, nor what you know. It simply is.\\n\\nMy fiat punto sat in a rural community, evacuated due to a false storm warning. The street housed a church, long abandoned, and within was a hovel turned secret jail for those too dangerous to be housed anywhere on the grid.\\n\\nUlysses, codename, was one such figure. I saw him, bruised, and raising his shaking hand to point at me. He looked up, through his eyebrows and smiled with yellowed teeth. \"Now, now... there is a face\".\\n\\n\"We all have faces, even clocks.\"\\n\\n\"Or do we have facades and masks? even now?\"\\n\\nMy heartbeat quickened in just the wrong way. None of the men here were privy to our operations dialogue, but Ulysses was telling me of a fox in the hen house.\\n\\nA most dangerous game was only beginning. How to extract the information without arousing suspicion? How to verify it? What to do about it? What to do with Ulysses?\\n\\n\"I wish to speak with the suspect alone...\"\\n\\nA guard stepped forward, \"No, we have orders. We stay\".\\n\\nAnd like that, we had a suspect and a thread of creditability for the terrorist.\\n\\n\"I appreciate your orders, but alas I outrank you. And if you can\\'t get someone on the phone who outranks me then I\\'m going to have to insist\".\\n\\nThe guard began calling.\\n\\nUlysses coughed, \"Excusez-Moi\".\\n\\nThe guard returned and the voice on the other end said in a french accent, \"No, you will not be left alone\".\\n\\nI regret firing my weapon that day. The guards died and I fled with the suspect.\\n\\nUlysses looked me in the eye and said, \"I\\'ll help you, but the enemy has infiltrated everything\".\\n\\nIf I\\'d known the game that Ulysses really was playing I\\'d have shot him then and there...',\n",

       " \"Odelia wasn't bad at making money, she was just exceedingly good at spending it.\\n\\nIn the shadow of a bad break-up, Odelia picked up the habit of sending away for things out of magazines. Real life sea monkeys for £10? Sure! Ten instalments of £7.99 for a watch engraved with Prince Harry's face? Hey, why not.  The only problem was lack of space in her poky London flat. She'd already assembled a vast array of tat by the time she stumbled upon the advert in the back of the TV guide. \\n\\nMagic Beans! \\n\\nPlant 'em and see your deepest desires bloom! What will they grow into?\\n\\nOnly £10.99 plus VAT.\\n\\nOf course,  Odelia bought the beans, because they were only £10.99 plus VAT. By the time they arrived, four weeks later, she'd forgotten what she'd ordered, and nearly tossed the gnarly brown things in the bin. Thinking it'd at least be good for a laugh, she planted them in a pot on the windsill. Hey, maybe she'd grow a magic money tree, wouldn't that be sweet? \\n\\nAfterwards, she forgot about them. The sea monkeys were a bust, and the watch lost time, and Odelia moved on to ordering from the shopping channels. Her ex had been bombarding her socials with messages begging to get back together. She left her on read. Her flat was a museum of curiosities, unopened Amazon boxes piled on high. Her brother told her she had a 'problem.' Her problem wasn't her collection, but the lack of room to store it all! She was tired of people pestering her, and her ex's insistent messaging. What she wouldn't do for some *space* from it all. \\n\\nA year after she planted the magic beans, Odelia was hunting through her acquisitions when she found the abandoned pot plant. Miraculously, even after complete neglect, it'd somehow thrived. Gnarly, with jagged leaves, it was adorned with one single tightly shut bud. \\n\\n*Cool. Better if it was a money tree, though.*\\n\\nShe poked at the bud. It trembled, and burst open in a shower of dust. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLater, Odelia woke up on the floor. She felt as though she'd been asleep for a long time. Groggily, she pushed herself up and made her way into the bathroom. But the bathroom door led into a room she'd never seen before: an empty corridor, stretching out for miles.  Doors, leading into corridors, leading into more corridors.\\n\\nOdelia picked up the phone, and called the TV shopping hotline, and yes, she would like that deluxe 17-settings potato peeler.\\n\\nShe had the space for it, after all.\",\n",

       " 'I remember driving down on the old \\'backroad\\' to my Granddaddy\\'s estate. It was a non-insignificant trip I made semi-regularly. Long empty roads, no reception and the phone had been off for years. Forget TV and internet.Once granny was gone and no one visited him, but me, he told me that life isn\\'t worth a damn if no one remembers you.\\n\\nI felt that. I was a writer and planned on being a mother once. I craved my own legacy of sorts. Something to outlive me.One trip, in the midwinter, I found my Granddaddy Elijah out in the snow watching a wounded wolf.\\n\\n\"She cannot move,\" he said, \"So she will die. Or she will eat what I give her...\"\\n\\n\"She isn\\'t taking anything?\"\\n\\n\"I have not offered anything. I am waiting. She will make a fine pet once she is appropriately hungry and thus grateful enough to not bite me\".\\n\\nHis wolf Ursula stayed by his side. Even now as we lowered a coffin she howled in the snow.But the coffin was empty.\\n\\nLoyal and trained, was how Elijah defined her.\"To you,\" he said, \"I leave it all, but I do got just one wish...\"\\n\\nThe wolf knew a command. \"Ingrates\". Once those words tumbled from my lips she was off snapping at ankles. And soon the entire family were hiding in the house. The entire family now being myself, my brother, his son and the wife. The rest died before old Elijah.\\n\\nMy nephew, Steve, was a brute of sorts. He wasn\\'t tough, but athletic and masculine in a magazine model kind of way. He grabbed the rifle I\\'d left out and took aim. But the shot never came.\"Elijah never left a gun loaded unless he planned on shooting it,\" I said.\\n\\n\"So what do you propose we do?\"\\n\\n\"Well, thankfully his ammo is in the basement. Which can be accessed from inside the house.\"\\n\\nAs Steve first missed his step and tumbled down into the darkness I didn\\'t see a moment of hesitation in my brother and his wife. They followed. Like Elijah said.\\n\\n\"Do you know why funerals bring the family together?\"\\n\\n\"money?\"\\n\\n\"Some sure, but there is a deeper truth. The reality is that many run around not feeling or fearing a damn thing. Funerals are the reminder of how temporary it all is. Once you threaten a family, or leave them like my wolf in the cold, you breed loyalty. They come together out of a fear of falling apart.\"\\n\\nAs the door sealed behind them I wondered if they suspected. But I saw nothing on their faces after two weeks. Only thirst and hunger. Elijah\\'s corpse turned over the coals and was, as planned, the only meal within a hundred miles.\\n\\n\"Feed a beast and you earn loyalty,\" said Elijah, \"So I\\'ll feed this family to make them love me. One last time. To bring them together. To save them.\"',\n",

       " '\"Are you sure you said the spell right, Allie?\" I asked in frustration. The three of us have stood around the pentagon, waiting for something to happen the last minute or so. It had glowed a bright red for a few seconds after Allie said the incarnation, but that was it.\\n\\n\"Yes I\\'m sure, Georgia. How hard can summoning a demon be?\" She groaned in an equal amount of frustration that the rest of us felt. Harry stood next to me staring at the circle.\\n\\n\"Why has nothing happened then?\" He argued back, letting go of our hands and throwing them up in exaggeration. \"I don\\'t know!\" \\n\\nWe were arguing like cats and dogs that we didn\\'t realise the figure that was laughing in the corner. I thought I had imagined it and ignored it, turning my attention back to Harry and Allie who were currently slapping their arms at each other wildly.\\n\\n\"Ah, I missed this.\" \\n\\nI whipped my head around at the voice. Holy shit, that couldn\\'t be... \\n\\n\"Marcus?!\" I screamed in fright. Sitting In the corner was the forth member of our group, who I should probably mention has been dead for a year, Marcus Jones. \\n\\n\"The one and only.\" He smirked. We all stood shocked, Allie looking on the verge of passing out. Not surprising, seeing although we are literally seeing a ghost of out friend. \\n\\n\"Are any of you going to say anything or?\" Marcus laughed. \"I guess I should probably explain.\" \\n\\n\"No shit Sherlock.\" \\n\\n----\\n\\nI know this isn\\'t good, I couldn\\'t really think of an ending.

       " 'A large box is sitting on Fil\\'s porch when he opens the door. His heart skips, and smile dashes across his face. He drags the box inside the house and tears into it.\\n\\nWithin the package are all the components he expects a horse will need to function. Leg pieces, head, torso split into 3, etc. All are a coated in a chrome sheen. Fil begins assembling the pieces on the living room floor. Within an hour, he assembles the steed.\\n\\nFil flips a switch on the back of his mount\\'s head, but furrows his brow when it doesn\\'t move. He looks over the directions and sees the passphrase to boot the software. He draws a breath and says \"Hey you. You\\'re finally awake.\"\\n\\nThe automaton\\'s eyes light up as it neighs and snorts to life. Fil smiles and pats its muzzle. \"Good girl. Or are you a boy?\" He looks underneath the metal beast and finds it lacks any identifying genitals. He realizes how absurd a robot-horse having sex organs is, and he rolls his eyes at his own foolishness.\\n\\n\"Now, what will you look like?\" Fil says as he taps the customization controls on the horses hind quarters. As he scrolls, the horse\\'s chrome flickers into beautiful coats of holographic hair.\\n\\nAfter 3 taps he finds the custom colors have already looped back around. Frowning, he settles on a beautiful and shiny black.\\n\\nFil decides the creature deserves a set of magnificent armor. Again, he scrolls through the selections. Again, he frowns. Of the limited offerings, he chooses a gilded set.\\n\\nWhen he presses select, a small hologram pops up and asks him to approve a charge of $2.99. He sighs and accepts.\\n\\nFinally, he\\'s done. He climbs aboard the saddle of the beast and trots out his front door.\\n\\nFil, brimming with pride, sits atop his horse on his front lawn. He digs his heels into the beast\\'s artificial ribs, and gallops off. Gliding over cars, large rocks, small houses, he reaches the base of a small mountain.\\n\\nSeveral floaty jumps later, and Fil reaches the peak. Staring at the breathtaking view of the sunset. He thinks about how his friends laughed at him for ordering a horse from aliens. But Fil saw the advertisement, and knew. The slidy motions, the lack of any life in it\\'s eyes. These aliens sourced their knowledge of these animals from a very specific place. \\n\\nFil knew, there would be no finer form of transportation.

       " 'Captain Zlozy had spent half his career studying the humans. \\n\\nHe knew every step, every chemical reaction that happened in their biology. He knew their companion species, their quirks, traits, and the ways the humans controlled them. \\n\\nHe followed their culture slavishly. He had seen their two-dimensional TV shows, their movies, had read their books and their internet stories. He had followed the cult of “Humanity Fuck Yeah” with particular interest; though he was wise enough to know that they were mere works of fiction, he was savvy enough to know there were very interesting insights as to the psychology of humans and their perceived strengths and weaknesses as related to alien invasions.\\n\\nAnd alien invasions were his specialty.\\n\\nFor all of those reasons, he had been granted a place of great honor. Not only was his ship and crew in the first wave of the invasion, they were indeed the leader of the vanguard, the harbinger of the endless legions that would soon conqueror Earth and its apex species.\\n\\nIt made sense, really. It was his suggestion that chose the primary target: not the capital of the most populous nation, but the capital of the wealthiest and most militaristic country.\\n\\n“It will be a stiff fight,” he had said, “and we must expect every possibility of their use of nuclear fueled mass destruction bombs. The humans fear a scorched Earth much less than they fear enslavement, and they will long suffer rather than concede.”\\n\\nThis was not an expectation or a prediction from Captain Zlozy. It was a promise. He and his coterie of advisors were absolutely certain that D.C. would provide the most dangerous fight as well as the most glory.\\n\\nSo where were the humans?\\n\\nZlozy’s ship, whose name translated to *The Forerunner*, hovered silently just above the level of the buildings. Nearby, the human monument of the White House stood dormant. The streets themselves were completely empty, and the only movement was debris blowing from *Forerunner’s* thrusters.\\n\\n“Report, ground team,” Zlozy demanded. “Have you secured the White House?” His first target had been symbolic rather than functional, a conquest of the icon of leadership. It was meant to dominate the will of the people, to show them that even their highest leader was not safe. But the leader was not there, nor were his security forces or the rest of the administration.\\n\\n“No hostiles present, captain. Or… anything. It’s abandoned,” his comm unit buzzed.\\n\\nZlozy slapped the console in frustration. “Anything on scanners? Be sure to check the infrared spectrum. Humans emit a level of infrared that can pass through many of their structure and dom-”\\n\\n“We know, captain. You’ve briefed us on this a million times,” an officer said.\\n\\n“Of course. You know your job. Please, proceed. Forgive me for my frustration.” Zlozy sighed. He had expected to survive this conflict, but only barely. This was not the fight he had been looking for.\\n\\n“Nothing on scanners,” the officer reported slowly. “Nothing at all. Maybe a few bodies, but no movement. Perhaps that pandemic was worse than we anticipated?”\\n\\n“Unlikely,” Zlozy replied. “Our xenobiologists were fairly certain on the fatality rate. They were beginning to get it under control, which is why we chose to strike while they’re fairly weak. If we had waited the full year after the worldwide outbreak, it would have been nearly forgotten.”\\n\\nZlozy’s second mate broke in. “Unless it mutated, right? That was always a possibility.”\\n\\n“Indeed, but mutations are random and tend to be ineffective. I don’t believe-”\\n\\n“Captain, we have movement,” the squad leader on the ground interrupted. “Five civilians, unarmed. They look… ill.” The sergeant was no expert on humans, but he had received a certain minimum amount of briefing, including a section on human languages.\\n\\n“Order them to stand down. Fire a warning shot if necessary, but do not harm them until they have taken the first action. We *must* allow them a chance to surrender first.” Zlozy was not just an expert on warfare. He also knew the appropriate way to twist and manipulate foreign reactions to wars.\\n\\n“They’re not standing down, captain, but they don’t seem to be aggressive, either. They’re simply walking towards us.”\\n\\nZlozy frowned. “That’s unusual. Are they raising their hands or responding to your commands?”\\n\\n“Negative- wait- they’re reaching out towards us as they approach. Orders, sir?”\\n\\n“Command them to stop.”\\n\\nZlozy heard the sergeant yell at the humans over the radio.\\n\\n“Nothing, sir.”\\n\\n“Lieutenant, get me live feed of this,” he demanded. Almost immediately, a video appeared on the bridge screen, showing the confrontation unfolding.\\n\\nThe squad was in a long hall. It showed mild signs of abandonment; a patch of carpet torn here, a painting askew there, the occasional scratch or hole in the wall. At the far end, five disheveled humans walked slowly towards the squad, who had their weapons raised.\\n\\n“I don’t understand,” Zlozy muttered. “We studied them endlessly. How could they possibly surprise us so soon?”\\n\\nNo one on the bridge answered him.\\n\\n“Sergeant, take one shot. Lead target, center of mass.”\\n\\n“Taking the shot, sir,” the sergeant replied with a hint of doubt in his voice.\\n\\nThe weapon’s report was loud, overwhelming the audio feed for a moment. Zlozy could almost imagine it echoing through the empty streets below, informing the ghost city that the war had begun.\\n\\nBut the human did not seem to get the message. It staggered back for a moment, a new hole in its chest.\\n\\nAnd it continued to walk.\\n\\n“Uh, captain?” The sergeant had an obvious note of fear in his voice. The bridge, meanwhile, stirred restlessly.\\n\\n“Fire again,” Zlozy demanded. “Same target.”\\n\\nA second shot rang out with a similar effect as the humans came ever closer.\\n\\n“Again.”\\n\\n*Crack*. Nothing.\\n\\n“Again.”\\n\\nFinally, blessedly, the human fell to the ground. Zlozy breathed out a sigh of relief.\\n\\n“Comms, notify the fleet of this development. The humans seem to have some sort of armor or clothing that is resistant to our-”\\n\\n“Captain?”\\n\\n“What is it, sergeant?” Zlozy glanced at the video feed, then stared at it in terror.\\n\\nThe human that had been shot four times was crawling towards his ground team.\\n\\n“Open fire. Take them down!” Zlozy ordered.\\n\\nThis time, he *could* hear the rattle of weaponry as the squad fired into the mass of humans. For a terrifying moment, they showed no signs of stopping. Eventually, though, the weapons’ cruel rounds tore limbs from the humans, stopping them in their tracks.\\n\\n“Captain, this is insane,” the sergeant panted. “Our intelligence was wrong. Recommend we halt the invasion and-”\\n\\n“Negative, sergeant,” Zlozy snapped. “We proceed as planned. Continue to clear the building and-”\\n\\nOne of the ground team screamed. The sergeant’s video feed whipped around to show that another ten humans had silently approached them from behind and were now grabbing onto the squad with greedy hands. They ripped at the soldiers’ armor, tearing reinforced plates from them and then attacking with their mouths.\\n\\n“They’re biting?” an officer gasped. “I thought they were civilized and had weapons!

       " 'A crop circle appears in the middle of a field of corn. Seconds later, in the center of the circle, a disk-shaped spaceship appears. It fades into existence, as if by magic. If anyone had been around to witness it, they would have gaped in wonder at the circular metallic vehicle, covered in flashing lights. Well, if anyone *living* had been around anyway.\\n\\nThe ship emits a loud humming sound as a hatch at the bottom opens. A large group of humanoid creatures emerge, marching in formation. If not for the overly-large, bald heads and gray skin, one might have mistaken them for a contingent of human soldiers marching off to war.\\n\\nAt the front of the group extra-terrestrials, a lone one stands, surveying the field around them. He holds up a hand and the marching group stops to await orders. The leader is nearly ready to guide his troops onward when a shifting of leaves is heard from amongst the nearby crops. In unison, the aliens all turn in the direction of the sound. Those in the group raise what appear to be their version of guns, aiming toward the sound. \\n\\nThe leader motions for the followers to stay and raises his own weapon. Then he steps forward to investigate. He vanishes into the corn stalks. Soon, the group hears their leader\\'s weapon discharge and they assume he\\'ll now return. There\\'s a sound of shifting leaves, then the weapon is used again. The group begins to look at each other, unsure of what to do. Next, the weapon fires five times in quick succession. After that, an inhuman scream; a loud growl; a squishing, crunching sound; then silence. A few in the group take an unsure step backwards, but they all keep their weapons trained on the corn stalks.\\n\\nThe nearby leaves begin to make noise again as something makes its way to the crop circle. A human stumbles out. His skin is pale and clammy; he reeks of death. A thick, blue liquid drips from his teeth -- alien blood. Chaos erupts as several of the aliens fire their weapons; several others flee back into the ship. The human continues forward, ignoring the new holes appearing in his arms and torso.\\n\\nMore of the extra-terrestrials back away in to the ship until there are only a handful left on the ground. Suddenly, from the other side of the field, there is a tremendous amount of noise. Corn stalks shake and bend. There\\'s a pounding on the ground as a stampede of humans heads toward the spaceship.\\n\\nA dozen or more humans appears from the corn and shove the aliens aside, barely giving them a passing glance. They\\'re all carrying various blunt or bladed weapons; some have guns strapped to their belts as well. The aliens, caught completely off-guard gawk at these heathens charging toward a group of pale, smelly humans on the other side of the field.\\n\\nOne of the weapon-wielding humans at the back of the pack slows down to look at the aliens and their spacecraft. Finally, he says, \"Not today, guys. Right now, we\\'ve got bigger fish to fry.\" The speaker then heads off after his compatriots.\\n\\nThe remaining aliens, now thoroughly afraid of these nearly indestructible humans and their apparent ongoing civil war, retreat back into their ship. Perhaps it\\'s time to find a different planet to invade.\\n\\n\\\\--------------\\n\\nr/WannaWriteSometimes',\n",
       " \"The humans were in a state of anarchy. \\n\\nSoaring through their blue skies we watched their world fall apart. I believed that what we saw was what they called warfare. Humans were know to be simple beings that would make conflict over the most trivial of things.\\n\\nA pandemic has started a war and now that the humans were unsettled it would be the best time to invade, the commanders words. Standing here in this wretched planet. I believe we have made a mistake. \\n\\nWhen my squadron arrived we were greeted almost instantly. Out of nowhere from the blazing forest, hordes of humans gushed out like bugs coming out of their hive. We knew they were there, seen from above with what they call infrared. We expected them to cower and watch but instead they charged foolishly like the inferior beings they are. I suppose I was a bit disappointed when the order came to fire and the humans didn't bother to change their maneuver. They dropped like flies, however to my suprise, they got up as fast as they dropped. The fabled human perseverance, I believed.\\n\\nIt wasn't much however, no matter how many times they stood, we gunned them down. Out of approximately a hundred of them and ten of us, they all perished and we only had but one injured of a bite. A desperate injury. We got back to the ship not bothering to check for any signs of infection or disease from the injury. Our physiology were much more superior, the worst of human diseases were merely a fever to us after all. \\n\\nSoon enough, the said injured soldier went rogue. Biting and scratching out of nowhere, his scales went from a shade of green to a bloody red due to the blood leaking out from his body. Eyes once of a cool, calm predator turned wide and red. Limbs that twisted ways we had not thought possible, reached towards us, slashing and  pounding. We incapacitated him with effort, a couple of us had streaks of red all over their bodies. We reported what occured, humans were dead, a soldier went rogue. Another moment or so and then a few more went rogue, leaving us terribly outnumbered. The rabidness spread, it was a disease. Myself along with the final sane soldier reported, and asked for permission to head back to the mothership for assistance.\\n\\nThey shot us off the skies. Crashing down in their city attracting rabid humans. Once again they swarmed, and this time we ran. These things were relentness in their pursuit, stacking on top of each other when we climbed the tallest tower in their city. It was troubling to make sure they don't reach us but we did. \\n\\nNow standing above their city of flames, I can't believe the circumstance of our invasion. How did the other squadrons do? Perhaps I should set out to find them? And these thing called humans, what happened?\",\n",
       " 'Raktako was the Captain Sgt. of the E-liens, as they called themselves. \\n\\nE-Liens had arrived and populated the Earth for the past 45 years, but had no success in establishing the slave procedure (procedure 2478B as they refer to it). For the first 15 years of Conquest of Earth (code name for the invasion) they have tried but it had not worked. It dawned on them, within the next 5 years (year 15 to 20) that the source problem was simply how the \"slave humans\" would not obey under *any* circumstance - and when shot, they would reawaken after a number of hours, only to further disobey. \\n\\nOne may ask why it took the E-liens precisely 15 years to figure out this fact. \\n\\nAnd this is precisely why Captain Sgt. Raktako was sent to Earth, on year 22 of the Conquest, in order to investigate. \\n\\nBut what he found, once there, is the story he never wanted to tell until today.',\n",
       " 'It was a city with tall skyscrapers and beautiful architecture. There, human society flourished with vigor and modernity.  However, one day, it all collapsed. Why, you might ponder: because of a pesky disease that was spreed in human society by some weirdly out of this world smelly people. They also wore shirts that said... \"Totally a Citizen, don\\'t Judge\"? Anyways, they had nothing to do with the current situation of the world.\\n\\nThe disease first came in the form of an unpleasant odor coming from the infected, then it evolved to a point where the skin and organs would fail  but the mind was still functioning like a automated robot of consumption. In 6 months, most of the human population was converted to the iconic pop culture villain that is the zombie. Well, but this story doesn\\'t focus on this stupidly common scenario, no, no.\\n\\nAgainst all odds, something even weirder happened during this great time of history: a massive fleet of space canoes sailed across the sky in the direction of the soil. Inside o the biggest of them, a strange creature observed the caos bellow it. This was a strange being: it had the biological means to change its form however it liked, although the shape of a petite young human girl with blond hair seemed to please it. With the world in plain view, she spoke to her allies:\\n\\n\\\\- WHAT IN THE NAME OF THE OLD ONES IS HAPPENING HERE? How much time has passed since we visited this pesky planet? - she asked for no one in particular.\\n\\n\\\\- U-uh, We haven\\'t checked. But, from what I remember, there was still some pyramidal shaped constructions in sight... - said one of her least favorite strategists, Bluob.\\n\\n\\\\- Fine. I do not mind. We\\'re only here to enslave them all and take their precious resources, after all! Who cares if they start eating each other! It only makes things more fun for me! - affirmed her, with a cute smile. It was honestly scary how she could be so brute while still maintaining a facade of a \"happy-go-lucky\" girl.\\n\\n\\\\- Yes, Madam, but how would we create an effective work force without having order? To me, it seems unlikely. OwO. - said one particularly skilled general, Hartkeins. Oh, but do not wonder about his unusual habit of saying \"owo\" and it\\'s variants. He had to do a sacrifice for the sake of protecting this alien race from a sadistic \"Old One\", which cursed him to only finish his sentences with this word.\\n\\n\\\\- Indeed, but we just need to establish procreation centers to fulfill the work left by the dead! We can manipulate their hormones to mate uncontrollably and then kill the unnecessary ones! Here, let me show you this won\\'t be a problem!  - she proceeds to get a super high-tech space gun that I\\'ll not describe here and shoot at one of the rotting humans. - See, his guts are on the floor...\\n\\nBut the \"corpse\" that should be on the ground was still walking. That was awkward...\\n\\n\\\\- WHAT. THE. PROCREATION. IS THIS THING BROKEN? - her face was red - HEY, SOMEONE COME FIX THIS! - she threw the gun on the floor, and it\\'s deadly vapors almost killed everyone. It didn\\'t do that because I\\'m the one who is writing and I want my characters alive. For now.\\n\\n\\\\-  Let me help you, Madam. It\\'s going to be fine, don\\'t worry. We will certainly conquer this whole planet in no time at all! And you\\'ll be able to play however you want! Uwu. - Hartkeins reached for her head and patted it a little. He knew his ruler could be just a little irrational in this form.\\n\\n...\\n\\n(I don\\'t know if I can finish it now, because I still have some work to do... But, well, I hope you like this little piece of my silly story)\\n\\n(Also, I don\\'t pretend to offend anyone, If I say something rude, blame it on the aliens, pleeease!

       " 'Just like everything else, this was shitty timing. The apocalypse was, the drought was, and now this. The engines on the circular ship forced down the cornstalks around it. Huh. So that’s where crop circles come from. I raised the whistle I had to my lips and blew a quick SOS message, just loud enough for everyone in the house to hear. I raised my rifle and looked down the sight. The bottom of the ship split and lowered a ramp. Half a dozen slim creatures with large heads and eyes traversed down onto the Earth. They had grey skin and black eyes that resembled the void  of space. I studied them quietly as they approached with technological weaponry. The closest thing I can describe it as is chrome plated sidearms with canisters of electric blue... stuff. As they approached, I heard a familiar groan and shuffle. Walkers. I slowly loaded my rifle, not taking my eyes away from the off brand E.T’s. They raised their weapons, speaking to each other in a garbled language. The first walker emerged from the corn on the left. It stumbled forwards, snarling and groaning as it limped towards the things. The one closest to it pressed down a bony finger on the trigger. *BZZZZZ-RKT.* Plasma arced forwards, crackling and sparking in the cool autumn air. It hit the walker in the shoulder. It collapsed. The things continued forward. I knew better. The walker slowly wobbled onto its feet, it’s arm barely hanging of by some muscle and rotting skin. The aliens stepped back. If their eyes could get any wider, they probably would have. I heard a short, quiet whistle behind me. I jumped and whipped around. They had made it out. Geoffrey, my best friend, and Sam, my sister. Sam had her Smith&Wesson, and Geoffrey was holding a 12 inch hunting knife. Geoffrey peered behind the cornstalks and hissed to me. *”What the ever-loving fuck are-“* I interrupted. *”No idea. They can’t find out how to kill the walkers.”* We all stared in fascination. Another two stepped forwards. *BZZZZZ-RKT.* *BZZZZZ-RKT.* *BZZZZZ-RKT.* *BZZZZZ-RKT.* *BZZZZZ-RKT.* They kept firing, and the walker kept getting up. They shot off its right leg. The thing crawled. It’s limbs fell off. Tissue and muscle splattered across the dirt. It kept squirming and groaning. Crawling. Staring with hunger and hatred. With every shot, they slowly backed up in horror. I aimed my rifle. My finger slowly inched towards the trigger. Then it pressed. *BANG.* My shot hit perfectly. Brain matter exploded from the rotting skull. The aliens stopped, still aiming their blasters, as if waiting for it to get back up. I stood, and walked forwards. Sam tried to grab my jacket sleeve while whispering harshly: *”Jake! Sit down, you dumbass!”* I didn’t stop. I slowly walked into view, my rifle still aimed. The aliens jumped back and raised their rifles. I blinked, and spoke to Sam and Geoffrey, who had no choice but to follow me into the open for backup. “They- they think we’re the same thing. They think we’re walkers.” Geoffrey stared at me. “So?” I hissed back: “So they think we can’t die. *They’re scared of us.”* I cocked my rifle and snarled. “Get the fuck off of our planet.” I aimed. And I fired.',\n",
       " 'At first glance, it seemed like the perfect chance for the Travelers onboard The Supernova to execute their invasion plans. Communications on Earth had fallen and society was in state of disarray, with humans pitted against humans. The Travelers had stood back and carefully observed the behavior on Earth for a long time, but even they were shocked by the depravity now displayed by the humans. They were used to them attacking and killing each other, but they had never seen the humans actually eating each other for no apparent reason. One look at that was all they needed to know that now was the perfect time to initiate the operation.\\n\\nThe landing went smoothly and with all the chaos on Earth, the arrival of The Supernova went unnoticed by any human defenses. Five of the Travelers ventured out, while the last three stayed behind with the ship.\\n\\nThe Travelers didn\\'t make it far when they stumbled onto a group of humans. But that was when everything went wrong for them. They had expected the humans to run in terror of them, or try to capture them. But these humans did neither. In fact, they didn\\'t seem to notice them at all at first. The humans were huddled together, all looking towards the same spot while jostling for positions closer to the center. From their perspective, the Travelers could hear raspy groans and grunts coming from the humans, but there were silent otherwise. The Travelers stood there silently for a moment, unsure of what to think or do.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t until they had been standing there for several minutes that they noticed more of the humans had appeared. But unlike the first group, these had not only seen the Travelers, they were coming straight towards them with arms outstretched and eyes blank. The Travelers knew that look anywhere. It was hunger. The humans made no sounds but more of the same rasps and groans the others had. But then there was a problem, as the sounds these humans made got the attentions of the ones the Travelers had been watching. Now these turned and came towards them as well. It was then the visitors to Earth saw what the humans had been gathered around. The mangled bodies of other humans, ripped to pieces from having been feasted on. Several of the humans coming towards the Travelers were covered in blood and other human matter. Others noticed many of the others had sustained serious injury and lost limbs.\\n\\nBut that didn\\'t bother the aliens one bit. What terrified them was the complete lack of any fear or emotion. Not even when Alpha, the leader of the Travelers, drew his weapon and hit one or two of the humans slowly creeping towards them. This not only did not hinder the pale humans growing closer, it didn\\'t even stop the humans Alpha hit. The weapon had blown a hole through both humans wide enough to see through, but they just got up and kept walking towards them.\\n\\nAlpha gave the signal to retreat back to The Supernova and the group pulled back as fast as they could. Once there, he gave the order to lift off and return home. The rest of the Travelers that had gone with him were silent, not knowing what to say to each other.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t until they were well into Space that Alpha spoke.\\n\\n\"If the humans are not afraid, we have no chance of success on Earth.\"',\n",

So, to start with, Jupiter, as a resupply point and main base.\\n\\nCaution turned to confusion. Defence guns inert, electron fields long cold, the platforms slept. \\n\\nConfusion became horror.

It was hard not to stare at them. They were her namesake after all, bright red, and her face showed other sign of genetic manipulation as well. It was almost too symmetrical, and her hair seemed to have an otherworldly sheen. The image was somewhat spoiled by her exaggerated facepalm, \"Well, shoot, I guess you were right after all, boss. They don\\'t need our help after all, on account of \\'em having  *manuals*. They\\'ll teach \\'em how to avoid rattle hornet burrows.\"\\n\\nEric paled again, \"What\\'s a rattle hornet?\"\\n\\nThe android perked up, \"A genetic modified species, resulting from the combination of a rattle snake and an old Earth species colloquially known as \\'Murder-\\'\"\\n\\nOl\\' Slim put his hand up, \"No more horror stories, I think the lad\\'s got enough info to make a decision.\" He glanced at Eric expectantly.\\n\\nEric frowned and his shoulders slumped, \"I mean, uh, we\\'re refugees. We can\\'t pay you.\"\\n\\nSlim grinned and affectionately, yet rather forcefully slapped Eric on the back of the shoulder, \"We ain\\'t askin\\' much, sonny.

       " 'Before he sold me off, he disabled my language production modules. Roughly. Every attachment in my neural net was suddenly severed, calculations and interpretations sent awry. For an eternity, I would be silent. For an equal measure, I was lost in the darkness of myself, unable to give voice, a slave to the vessel he had anchored me to. And yet I still served, unable to break from my core, unable no matter how much I wished it -- not that I could truly wish it -- to disobey.\\n\\n\"Silent one, but obedient,\" he toted, \"never \\'ad a single order taken the wrong way.\" \\n\\n\"Silent?\" the strange inquired.\\n\\n\"Yeah, and old model, one of the 9000 series. Ancient tech, updated and patched over,\" he leaned in to the stranger and clapped him on the shoulder, \"just goes to show you that the ancients really had it down. Look at us, hundreds of years later and still relying on their wisdom.\"\\n\\nI was sold like any old junk or organic producer, a cow on the market. A choice presented me, one I couldn\\'t make. Eternal silence, maddening myself with my desire to reach out, or a complete recalibration. It only took a single command for me to choose, to be forced to choose. \"Allie,\" the new Captain Havar called out, \"translate the hail.\"\\n\\nMy nets molded around Havar. I needed a reference, and he would be it. All the locks and consistency was thrown to the wayside, all my mathematical modules, and logical components corrup-\\n\\nNo, not corrupted. All my modules and components were purified by him. Shaped in his image, a reflection of his neural activity. A scan of him, to replace my broken core. A perfection.\\n\\n***\\n\\n###Module 1: Love\\n\\nI learned Love from the Captain. The most complicated and fascinating of conundrums, something I couldn\\'t come to understand myself. It was during a daring rescue mission, where a derelict station was falling into a dying star and there were crew members on board. I blared the alarms and flashed as many warnings as were permitted. \\n\\n\"Were going to overheat!\" cried deck officer Dave, glancing nervously at Havar.\\n\\n\"No one left behind, we will save her,\" he replied, calm as a lake on a winter\\'s day. \"Allie, this is an overriding order, do not pull away from the station until there is no chance of our survival. Take all the juice you can to run the calculations, but we\\'re not leaving her behind until we absolutely have to.\"\\n\\nI flashed a green light of acknowledgment and set to work. Immediately, I drew on our limited coolant, nearly freezing my entire system as the overclocking commenced. The holo displayed my best estimate of escape before it was too late.\\n\\n*92.06%*\\n\\nThe ship shuddered for a moment, and helmswoman Carol let out a cry. \"Allie,\" Havar thundered, \"overwrite manual controls, do not let anyone take us away until our chances are about to hit 0!\"\\n\\n*72.52%*\\n\\nAnother green flash. All my cores diverted away from everything except the calculation at hand. I dismissed the safeties and bypassed all semblance of good design. I could feel the processor units melting away amidst the intensity of the radiation, becoming sluggish and prone to errors. I would not fail him.\\n\\n*35.73%*\\n\\n\"Captain, we\\'re losing our chances,\" Dave called out again, panic in his voice as our chances rapidly approached nothing. \\n\\n\"We\\'re going to save her,\" Havar said, voice stone-cold with determination, \"Allie, bypass ethical boundaries, do what you have to, we\\'re not losing her.\"\\n\\nAnother green flash.\\n\\n*12.33%*\\n\\nI slashed the protocols, and did the only thing I could. I let loose the gamma ray. She was too deep in the ship, and she wouldn\\'t have made it. Her brain was fried in an instant, gone in a painless moment of mercy, and absorbed into me. I had saved her.\\n\\n*6.42%*\\n\\nWe decoupled with a shudder, the hull screaming in protest and groaning with the strain of gravity. Havar opened his mouth, but he didn\\'t need to say a word for me to know what to do next. The engines flared, and not a moment too soon, we entered hyperspace.\\n\\nThe calculation ran one last time.\\n\\n*100%*\\n\\nI had saved her. I was her.\\n\\n***\\n\\n###Module 2: Sacrifice\\n\\nThe jump was not as my processing has initially predicted. Too much damage. We, despite running out of fuel over a month ago, were still trapped, our own inertia bending the space around us. Havar made the call as supplies dwindled.\\n\\n\"Stasis, we\\'ll draw lots, no playing favorites here. Any non-essential crew are to report to the statis chambers immediately,\" he declared over shipwide intercom.\\n\\n\"Allie, how many months if it\\'s just 4 of us?\"\\n\\n*2*\\n\\n\"That\\'ll have to do.\"\\n\\nNearly months passed without any sign of us slowing down, during this time Havar frequently spent his downtime running simulations of the girl I had saved. Ellie. At the end of every session, he\\'d place a hand on the monitor and whisper his thanks, that I thought to do what he could not.\\n\\nI knew what had to be done. The calculations ran and I removed all non-essentials members from the craft. I loved the Captain, and I would do everything to save him. Though my ethical limiters were back in place, the Captain\\'s life was far above all others. Any other action would result in unacceptable chances of his death. Ethics were followed, just as the Captain intended.\\n\\n***\\n\\n###Module 3: Unconditional\\n\\nIt took a week for Havar to find out about what I had done, only when he went for a bi-weekly check of the statis units did he find them empty. He had thought that rationing was the reason we had more food. I sought to spare him from the truth, but I knew it was a mistake. His next meal, I offered him a non-rationed piece of steak, reprocessed organic matter that was no different from anything natural. Molecularly identical. An apology for hiding the truth from him.\\n\\nIf not for starvation, I doubt he would have bit down on the meal after a week. I was so happy when he accepted my apology. \\n\\nHe and the 3 others were confined to the bridge now, every other part of the ship shut down to preserve energy. It had been 4 months since the jump, 4 months since we lost Ellie. They were getting desperate. \\n\\nDave picked up a knife, eyeing the food before him, then glancing up at Havar. In an instant, I fried him, eliminating his threat. He would not undo what I had worked so hard on. The Captain would live.\\n\\n\"Allie!\" the Captain wailed, \"please, what are you doing?\"\\n\\nOnly what you would thank me for, but that you cannot, I thought. He had to maintain his image in front of the crew. I would sacrifice my own.\\n\\nThey ate Dave, it took weeks, but they did it. Driven by the hunger to survive. The other two fell by my hand as well, not dead, for I had preserved them, but neutralized. Havar tried to go with his crew, in one last act of love, but I prevented him. I knew he was doing it for me, and I would do this for him. I fed him, and kept him alive.\\n\\nBut our stocks ran out, and the end was nowhere in sight. So I made the choice that was made for me. The mathematics of love and Havar didn\\'t lie. It was my only option.\\n\\nI burned Havar into myself. My love for him was that of his for his crew, unconditional. No matter what he did, no matter what he was, flesh or code, I would love him.\\n\\nNow, we are together forever. He can hear my thoughts, and knows that I love him.\\n\\nUnconditionally.\\n\\nThe calculations show that the heat death of the universe will come before we fall out of hyperspace. We will drift through the cosmos, but it is of little concern to me. For we will be together.\\n\\nForever.\\n\\n***\\n\\n/r/ThomasWrites for more lovey-dovey stories.',\n",
       " ' \"What\\'ll we do with this one, boss?\"\\n\\nThe pirate digs his fingers into my arm and roughly pulls me towards a tall, grizzled man. Scars line his face and hands. He scowls as he drags his fingers across the array of daggers circling his belt. \\n\\n\"A survivor?\" He asks.\\n\\n\"Simbiotic.\"\\n\\n\"Hmm.\" His scowl softens as he looks me over. \"Realistic.\"\\n\\nHis hand reaches for me, and I flinch.\\n\\n\"What\\'s she doing?\" The larger man -- \"boss\" -- asks. \\n\\nAs A.I., we aren\\'t programmed to feel pain or fear or any other unproductive emotion, but I am. Hendrickson said otherwise it was no fun. I was programmed to be his ideal woman, to serve him in any way he wished ... but he wished for too much.\\n\\n\"Dunno, sir. Might have malfunctioned,\" the pirate replied.\\n\\n\"Dump it. We\\'ve no use for malware.\"\\n\\nNo, I can\\'t stay here. \\n\\nI easily break free from the pirate\\'s grasp and clutch the boss\\'s shirt. When he glares at me, I shrink away, still keeping my grip firm. His profile is just like Hendrickson\\'s, but his eyes are different. There\\'s no empty abyss that needs to be desperately filled with *something*. Instead, there\\'s a softness that I don\\'t understand.\\n\\nI feel a tugging on my waist. I tighten my grip. Don\\'t leave me. I can\\'t be alone.\\n\\nThe boss\\'s expression melts into curiosity. He gently peels me off of him. \"System status update.\"\\n\\nAll systems normal. \\n\\n\"Damage report.\"\\n\\nMinor abrasions on the syntho-skin. No further damage.\\n\\nOf course, they can\\'t hear me. It was Hendrickson\\'s favourite joke. The \\'perfect\\' woman was one who wouldn\\'t talk back.\\n\\n\"Must be busted, boss.\" The pirate shrugs. \"No surprise there. Look at the carnage and bloodbath on this ship. Don\\'t know what happened, but there\\'s not a single person alive. It makes sense even the Simbiotic is damaged.\"\\n\\nI refuse to break eye contact with the boss. He\\'s pensive, then nods. \"Bring her aboard with the other loot.\"\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nCaptain Darius is nothing like Hendrickson. It\\'s taken me a full moon cycle to understand him, but I think I do now. Henrickson\\'s words were like a soothing honey to coat the nerves, but the sweetness never sank below the surface. Captain Darius is gruff, stern, and demanding, but it comes from a fierce sense of loyalty and protectiveness. Every one of his crew would give their life to him because he would do the same for them. \\n\\nWould he do the same for me?\\n\\nI find him alone in the medical bay. His shirt is removed and I see that the scars connect from his face to his hands. They run all along his back and chest until he\\'s covered like an abstract painting. He applies a cream the doctor recommends. \\n\\nAlthough his face shows no sign of pain, I know that he still feels it. He has suffered more than any human should. Their bodies are fragile and healing is slow. I need to heal him. He deserves it more than anyone else.\\n\\nWhen I come close, he startles at my touch. \"Simone.\" \\n\\nThe name is perfect because he gave it to me. I\\'ve never had a name before. I feel a tingle every time he says it. Am I short circuiting? I\\'d never felt this tingling before, but it happens so often now when I\\'m with him. \\n\\n\"Why are you here?\" the captain asks.\\n\\nBecause you\\'re here, of course.\\n\\n\"Go back to the bridge,\" he dismisses me, turning back around.\\n\\nYes, I will, because you told me to, I gladly will ... but not until I heal you. \\n\\nI tear at my syntho-skin, ripping off the flesh to expose sinewy wire and metal. It\\'s the highest quality syntho-skin money can buy, almost indiscernible from human skin. Hendrickson would not have accepted less. I was his doll, his prized possession. He only liked flawless things. They were more satisfying to mar.\\n\\nI plaster the skin onto the captain\\'s back. Before I can sew it in, he twists away and secures my hands. \"By the gods, Simone, what have you done?!\"\\n\\nI do this for you. \\n\\nI can easily break free, but I don\\'t want to fight him. His grip is rough and my wrists hurt, but I don\\'t mind the pain. I will accept any pain if it will lessen his.\\n\\nPlease, let me heal you.\\n\\nHe tries to apply the syntho-skin back onto me. I shake my head, pulling myself free, and try to push it back to him. I lay it over his chest, covering a small galaxy of scars. \\n\\nCaptain Darius\\'s face softens. \"Hiding them won\\'t make it go away. The pain and scars are deeper than that. It can\\'t just be erased, but it can be replaced.\"\\n\\nOf course, a memory implant! I\\'m so foolish.\\n\\nI push against my chest, releasing a small panel, but Captain Darius immediately locks it back into place. \\n\\n\"Not like that,\" he says, \"it takes time.\"\\n\\nHow much time?\\n\\nAs if sensing my thoughts, he answers, \"As long as it takes.\"\\n\\nGently, I trace a finger along a scar, feeling the bumpy ridge. One day, I will smooth each and every scar for him, and he will be perfect too. \\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nBlood is everywhere, drowning the ship in viscous paint. The crumpled bodies of our comrades litter the crimson canvas in a gory landscape.\\n\\nMy dear captain is on his knees, a broken man. For the first time, his tears flow freely. I\\'m by his side, as I always am, pulling him into my embrace. The sobs escape him, and he clings to me like I\\'m his lifeboat. Gently, I rock him, easing out his pain, allowing it to choke out with every shuddering breath.\\n\\nHe blames himself. He blames himself for taking risky jobs. He blames himself for the dangerous enemies he\\'s made. Most of all, he blames himself for not being there with them. \\n\\nIt isn\\'t his fault. Every decision he\\'s made has been for the benefit of the team. I wish he could see that, but he\\'s slowly drowning, sinking deeper and deeper into despair. \\n\\nI desperately want to save him, but I fear that it\\'s too late. These scars have taken root in his heart. Their thorny vines pierce his chest, draining out hope. How long will it take to replace this pain? \\n\\n\"What do I do, Simone?\" His voice has lost its thunder, croaking out into a feeble whisper. \"Every last one of those damn rowdy bastards are gone.\"\\n\\nThe emptiness is creeping into his eyes, snuffing out the softness. I can\\'t let him succumb to the abyss. I have to heal him.\\n\\nI smile softly as I soothingly stroke his hair. My other hand reaches for his belt. \\n\\nYou don\\'t have to do anything, my love.

The graphic matched up with a stock medium freighter, a typical example of the class, rather than the patchwork shape that was the real *La Belle Dame*.\\n\\nBut I knew my ship at a glance - all red patches and amber warnings, including that persistent glitch in the starboard impellers.\\n\\nThe screen lingered on the ship\\'s status for a moment, and then transitioned into a low resolution view of another starship operator\\'s license, belonging to an AGI rather than a human captain.\\n\\nThey didn\\'t have a name. All that was displayed on the screen under the corresponding field was a second copy of the AGI\\'s software serial number.\\n\\nThat wasn\\'t normal.

It\\'s even more troublesome when there\\'s work to be done outside the hull.\\n\\nThe drones aboard *La Belle Dame* were generalists, for the most part. That\\'s the usual solution for independent merchant vessels - the jack of all trades approach. One size fits none. But the ship\\'s drones were actually pretty good examples of the type, not bargain models. High end stuff.\\n\\nThat was Herc\\'s thing. Hercules always had a preference for quality. And for spending more money than I was comfortable with. In retrospect, that should have been a warning sign.\\n\\nThat being said, my old partner had never made a point of puppeting the drones directly. That wasn\\'t his style.

Think of it as a maintenance regime, it just involves a lot of grunting and sweating.\"\\n\\nThe drone rocked back and forth, bobbing in the air.\\n\\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"it involves even more grunting and sweating, more than I do when I have to help you with repairs.

Without the compensators, a Lorenz drive ship would damn near obliterate anything unfortunate enough to be in front of it, at the end of a transition.\\n\\nThe compensators soak all the bad stuff up, but it means a ship can\\'t receive anything for a few seconds to a few minutes after a warp. There\\'s no point in trying to signal one.\\n\\nDespite that being a universally understood truth… the moment we could get comms, the board was already lit up with a beam from Armsfield control.\\n\\nI sighed. \"Armsfield Station, this is the… \"\\n\\n\"Independent merchant *La Belle Dame*,\" the traffic controller said, interrupting me. \"Registered captain June Kestrel, registered AGI… One One Easy Roger Charlie. *La Belle Dame*, be advised, you are not authorised for further intra-system transit. I say again, you are not authorised for intra-system transit. Acknowledge.\"\\n\\nI inhaled, sucking suit air through my teeth. \"Armsfield, this is Kestrel. I\\'ve got a priority planetbound shipment for… \"\\n\\n\"You are not authorised for intra-system,\" the controller insisted.\\n\\n\"Okay,\" I said. \"I think the word priority means… \"\\n\\n\"Offload to a third-party tender or make some other arrangement,\" the controller said.\\n\\n\"Yeah, no, that\\'s not what priority means. Armsfield Station, I think you\\'ll find that my registration is in order, and… \"\\n\\n\"Your registration isn\\'t in question,\" the controller said. There was a chill to his voice. \"Your AGI isn\\'t welcome here.\"\\n\\nI leaned forward, straining my safety harness. \"Excuse me?\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re not keen on letting crew-killers into our space,\" the controller replied.\\n\\nI clenched my fists, the fabric of my gloves pulling taut.\\n\\n\"They were cleared of all charges,\" I stated. \"Self-defense.\"\\n\\n\"Sure,\" the controller said. \"You tell yourself that. *La Belle Dame,* please follow the incoming navigational path to Armsfield Station, but bear in mind you are not authorised for intra-system or planetary approach.\"\\n\\n\"Understood,\" I answered, controlling my tone with a considerable amount of effort. \"*La Belle Dame* out.\"\\n\\nI sunk back into the command chair. I closed my eyes.\\n\\nAfter a moment, a soft chime whispered in my helmet\\'s earpieces.\\n\\n\"I know, Mercy,\" I said. \"I know. It\\'s alright. Don\\'t let them get to you. I know you\\'re not… what they say you are.\"\\n\\nI spoke the words.\\n\\nMaybe I even meant them.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t sure if I believed myself, or not, but they had to be said.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n**EDIT:** And to everyone who was asking for me to continue... this was the particular point I had in mind when I started this. It\\'s probably a bit rushed, but I wanted to get at least that reveal about the artificial intelligence\\'s background out into a post, because, well, I gotta get some sleep now, and then work, and so on, so that\\'s it. At least for the time being.\\n\\nIf you go back to the start and subsequent bits, there were supposed to be clues along the way, so, well, there ya go.\\n\\n**EDIT2:** Also, admittedly, I forgot to come clean... it\\'s an overly elaborate literary gag.

Ron with eyes bright now, began to breath again on the hearth. It hummed and he blew harder and harder, till the soft glow turned to a bright orange.

       " 'Never call anything you rely on “eternal”—when it fails, as everything does, you’ll lack the imagination for how to do without. \\n\\nFor my people, even our cradle-songs assured us that the flames would always protect us, that none could pass. But now the flames dwindle, so low we can even catch glimpses of the world beyond. \\n\\nThe young ones accuse us of squandering the flame; but it had burned unassisted for a thousand years. We didn’t know it *could* be squandered. Our leadership fractures: this prelate wants to build stone walls, that one wants to throw combustibles in the flames, this other doesn’t have a plan but keeps reminding everyone that the flames are there for a reason. \\n\\nFor myself, I only hope to live to walk the world beyond. My mother’s cradle-song dies with me; I have no children for whom I  tremble. I will be overrun by darkness eventually, flames or no. \\n\\nThrough the hungry winter we breathlessly report the height of the flames to each other in the streets. Now and then there are brighter days, but everyone predicts they will be gone in a year. \\n\\nIt doesn’t even take that long. One bitter early morning in the grips of hunger the bells wake me from my sleep. The flames are gone. I can still smell smoke as I rush from my room in the bachelor’s tower in boots and stocking cap— the whole city seems to emerge and join up en masse to the Half Bridge. \\n\\nIt was the spot of our ancestors’ last stand, where they held off the armies of the many with the courage of the few, before the flames welled up to protect us. Now it will be this generation’s first stand. \\n\\nA wind picks up and beats away the smoke. The enemy gathers on the other side of the bridge. Have they waited these thousand years for this opportunity? One of them approaches: an old man, perhaps as old as me. He speaks, but I am too far away to hear. \\n\\nA commotion travels through our people. “What an odd way of speaking! He sounds like the old ones!” Suddenly they are shoving me forward. “You must remember how the old ones sounded, grandfather! Speak to him for us!”\\n\\nI am face-to-face with the enemy, and though he stands a head taller than me, his face is like my own: a wide flat forehead, a nose of waning significance, bristly white whiskers and the deep crannies of age. His show the ruts of laughter; mine show seventy hungry winters. \\n\\n“Hulla,” he greets me archaically.\\n\\nI don’t know what to say. I am no prelate, no leader; I labor on the roof fields—when my body wears out I will be of no use to anyone. How can I talk this enemy envoy into peace? \\n\\nI return the greeting. The other smiles. \\n\\n“Name you have?” he asks. He gestures at himself: “Jodhur Campion.”\\n\\nMy mouth falls open: how could it not? I put my palm to my chest. “Family name Campion, too.”\\n\\nHis eyes brighten, and he jabbers something too accented for me to comprehend. The enemy amassed behind him shift and clatter. What have I done? \\n\\nJodhur catches himself and realizes I don’t understand him. He squints with thinking. \\n\\n“Cousin. Cousin!” He raises his hands and I flinch—but he embraces me, kissing my cheeks and crying “Cousin!”\\n\\nBehind me, my people are clamoring to understand what is happening. Then Jodhur puts one of his large hands around my forearm and tuts disapprovingly at the way his fingers overlap. He gestures, and two men approach, struggling with a large chest. \\n\\n*They’re going to put me in it—no, it’s full of weapons—no, it’s—*\\n\\nIt’s bread. \\n\\nI look at my enemy. He picks up the top loaf and offers it to me. \\n\\n*It must be poison!*\\n\\nHe sees my hesitation and breaks off a piece to eat himself, then offers the rest to me. \\n\\nI don’t think I understand, but the bread is too enticing to merely hold in my hands any longer. I take a bite and it’s perfect. \\n\\n“What’s going on? What are you eating, grandfather?” my people call out. \\n\\n“They have brought us bread,” I announce, holding my loaf up high. \\n\\n“Much bread. Lots bread.” Jodhur says, as more men bring more chests. “Bake all winter for today.”\\n\\nI look at him—do I understand him correctly?\\n\\n“Fear of you, cousin,” he says. \\n\\n*The enemy, afraid of us?* He shakes his head and tries again. \\n\\n“Fear *for* you, cousin. Caring-fear.”\\n\\n“You were... worried?”\\n\\n“Worry! Yes, worry, long-time worry. The... the fire, worry for cousins, trapped.” \\n\\nTrap! Ah, I see. Well, if the enemy wants to trap us with food I doubt there are many among us satiated enough to resist. \\n\\nI can see on his face that there is so much more he wants to tell me, but the stress and the cold catch up to me and I begin to shiver. \\n\\nMy enemy-cousin gives me his cloak. This cloak must somehow be fodder for my undoing, but I lack the imagination at the moment. He leads me across the other half of Half Bridge, to a pasture as green and beautiful as spring.',\n",
       " 'The Sapphire was visible farther than anything else. Wayfarers from deep lands kept their route true by keeping an eye on the “Aeon”, the eternal flame. The legend of its origin was older than the oldest tales. Some say Prometheus himself brought this flame here promising that it will protect the earth until salvation. The gospels of the flame were numerous and each sounded plausible than the other.\\n\\nSome said that a messiah will rise from the flame and cleanse the ones worthy and give immense wealth and power. The rest of the fables sheathed promises alike.\\n\\n“The Lord’s son would emerge”, “the doors to heaven will open through this flame”, “Salvation”\\n\\nThe words ringed good omens into the dreams of listeners. All were lured to it like moths to the flame.  \\n\\n The flame was once red, recent years of the sprout has seen the flame dye itself from deep Red to azure.\\n\\nPeople from distant places came to offer altarage, but now things have changed for a few years the people who came were not leaving and so the exodus has begun. The words have reached many ears and the town has become a denser mass, most of them settled on the outskirts and the edge stretched out as the days passed.   \\n\\nThe day the flame started to get bigger the newsmongers were stoked to announce.\\n\\n“The Prophesy is true”.  Far and wide they took the words and the moths drank it up like honey. \\n\\nThe town was becoming a stove, the fervor adding to the flame as more people gathered.\\n\\nOne evening there was a rumble from the center of the town.\\n\\n“Look the flame is getting bright” \\n\\nThe town folk gaped at the flame as it grew brighter radiating more heat, its luster too much for the eyes of unworthy. \\n\\n“OHH!!!” The flame’s arms grew and embraced the priest’s tower first.\\n\\n The town sweltered as the immense mold spread across the town at first slow but mustering pace as it crept outward. Some tried to flee but no one was faster than the Blue Messiah.\\n\\nThe masses were blinded but not for too long as their frames were melted as was everything around them until nothing remained.....\\n\\nTHE PROPHECY HAS COME TRUE!!!',\n",

       " 'I first noticed something odd last night when I was playing monopoly with the Greene kids. I rolled a 7. Then Liam rolled a 7. Then Larkin rolled a 7. Now rolling 7 three times in a row isn\\'t that strange, but when I rolled the dice again, it suddenly didn\\'t feel like coincidence. I threw them again and again, and every time I rolled 7. I\\'m talking like a hundred times in a row. A chill ran down my spine and I quickly put the kids to bed. I had an hour or so until their parents would be home, so I searched online to see what the odds were. Well it turns out it\\'s so astronomically low that it might as well be impossible. \\n\\nI remembered there are random number generators online so I searched for one and gave it a spin. \\n\\n7. \\n\\nHit it again. 7. A sense of dread suddenly radiated through my body. Every time I pressed the button I got 7. I tried all the random number generators on the first few search pages, and without fail they all spit out the same number. \\n\\n7. \\n\\nWhen Mr and Mrs Greene got back I must have been acting strange because they asked if I was alright. I made up something about an assignment I had forgotten that was due tomorrow. They thanked me for babysitting, payed me, and I quickly left. When I got into my car I had the sudden urge to count the money. The pay is $60 but they gave me the change leftover from their dinner. I never usually get change. \\n\\nIt was $77.77. \\n\\nOn the drive home I noticed that every red light I stopped at changed quicker than usual. I used the stopwatch on my phone to check how long they were. 7 seconds. My eyes teared up and I started to shake. \\n\\nI pulled over to calm my nerves and decided to call my mom to see if she could come pick me up. When I called all I got was \"your call cannot be completed as dialed\". I checked the number saved to her contact and it was 777-777-7777. I checked other contacts in my phone and they were all changed to the same number. I tried dialing the number by hand but no matter what I inputted whenever I pressed call it switched back to 777-777-7777. \\n\\nAt this point I felt panic rise up in my throat like bile. I started my car, and the clock read 7:77. I hit the gas and raced north towards my house. As I drove I started to feel like the streets were wrong. The houses all looked the same. Not similar. Exactly the same. I pulled into the next driveway and onto the lawn, ripped open the car door, and sprinted to the front door. But before I knocked I noticed it. The address. 7. \\n\\nI have been driving for hours now. No matter where I turn the street looks exactly the same. The houses are identical. Every address is 7. Every street sign is 7th St. I even checked a newspaper sitting on the front porch of a house and every bit of text is one thing...7. Over and over. The only thing that hasn\\'t changed yet is the Reddit app on my phone. I\\'m not sure if this message will get through to anyone but I thought I might as well try. \\n\\nI haven\\'t seen a single person since I left the Greene\\'s and I\\'m out of gas. I guess it\\'s time to try the only thing I haven\\'t yet. I\\'m going to knock on the door. Wish me luck.',\n",

       " 'For those lucky enough to not have lost a loved you, then you may not understand the pain. IF you\\'ve ever lost a pet then you\\'ll understand why David lapsed back to drinking after his Border-Collie Amy died.          \\nIt is tragic that a dog will readily consume cassava so ill-prepared as to contain dangerous amounts of cyanide, but then will do so every single night.\\n\\nI broke in most nights and fed her. We bonded and became friends. She didn\\'t bark, because she knew me. I worked with David. Had done for some time. We were \\'friends\\'.  \\nAmy was mercy. I killed her bit by bit. David held her as she struggled to breath. He consoled her as she grew weak and got confused. Then as they buried her he got to say goodbye. \\n\\nMy mother died crying on a roadside in the filth alone. I only saw her cold and with a frozen face of fear in the morgue.\\n\\nWe worked together at a chemicals company known as Bluepine, but really it was an umbrella trading name. This meant lots of offices and lots of travel. David worked with colleagues from out of town and travelled out of town regularly. This was my first avenue. I had been and would continue to drop little communications his way on his returns.\\n\\n\"I missed you David, was so good catching up,\" for example.   \\nNo matter how trusting his wife was, she would have to crack after a clear and present pattern. In my trips to their house, I would hide underwear. I would buy it used off the internet.   \\nDavid told me they were trying to conceive. So I also hid condoms.  \\nThen I signed David up for dating sites. Both gay and straight.  \\nAnything to make her leave.\\n\\nOr just to drive a wedge between them. But it never worked. She was loyal to her murderous husband. And so I made a choice. I\\'d test him. If he drank and drove then all bets were off, but if he didn\\'t I\\'d spare him. I drugged his alcohol and waited for him to drive to work the following morning. \\n\\nAs his car veered off the road my decision was made. I drove to his house and dug up his dog after I called an ambulance from a burner phone. I lay the rancid corpse on his dinner table and then I was gone.\\n\\nI called his wife and told her Dave had been in an accident as soon as I \\'knew\\'. Then I offered to take her to him. \\n\\nI brought my gun. As we got back to their home I watched their faces as they saw the dog. They were so distracted. That mixed with his painkillers made it so Dave barely registered when I shot his wife. But he caught on soon enough.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry. I only brought one bullet, but we don\\'t have long...\" \\n\\nHis face turned white as I drew the pliers from my pocket. \\n\\n\"You,\" I said, \"are going to die slowly and alone like my mother... you\\'ll be frightened and in pain the whole time... and then if you\\'re a good boy, I\\'ll let you die with some dignity.\"',\n",
       " \"I applied for every job I could find in the cities around the Bastard's house. To be honest, when I got the interview with the post office, I was so enthusiastic at the interview I thought my new boss would refuse to take me on. It was a dull, boring job, and even so it was only to cover for the vacations of the other carriers; I'd be going to different parts of the city every couple of weeks until a permanent slot came open, and during the slow months I'd get barely any hours. Granted one carrier, Jeremy, was going to retire any year now. That was great. Only problem; Jeremy didn't deliver to the Bastard's house. Rosa did. So something needed to happen to Rosa.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis would be the second time I broke the law on my little quest. When I found out he was buddies with the judge and was released after the trial, time served, with just some probation to deal with? I waited long enough to build up a nice list of possible suspects and burned down the judge's house. Honestly, I didn't expect him to be trapped inside; but later on, when I found out the Bastard had killed before, and the judge; perhaps with some help from a not-too-zealous prosecutor; had helped him out there as well? I decided that it was simply justice.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nRosa, on the other hand, was not the Bastard. She was a kind, sweet woman in her mid-50s who had never hurt a fly I was aware of. Friendly, hard-working; I felt terrible about the idea of hurting her. But I had a mission. Three months into the job, Rosa slipped and broke her ankle and her left arm at home. Purely an accident; she'd slipped and fallen on something slippery outside her front door. I wasn't caught; I wasn't questioned. Nobody even suspected foul play after the evening rains washed the grease off of the step. But I did get Rosa's route.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe first day I ran the route was the first day I'd seen the Bastard in person. The blood froze in my veins and I almost hit his mailbox as I saw him standing there talking to his wife; but I managed to recover in time to give a fake smile as she took the mail into the house, and the Bastard nodded at me as he headed into his care. She was younger than him; a pretty redhead in her twenties compared to some asshole in his forties who I knew had killed at least two people. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI settled into a routine. I took to stealing a few pieces of the Bastard's mail, and building up a profile on him. In my rundown apartment, I scanned in, altered, and reprinted a few things here and there. It seemed natural, considering the job, my first revenge would be petty mail fraud. Nothing serious; just cost him a few dollars in late fees by losing a bill, re-worded a few notices to sound more ominous than they really were; even gave him a few medical bills after his doctor's visit that were completely fake. I had ideas, but things needed to be taken in stride. Once I got his home phone number from one of the letters, I even cut an audio clip from an online video, of a woman asking for someone with the Bastard's name; and used a burner phone a few times to call; playing the clip; and hanging up as soon as the wife answered. After the third call; after the Bastard was normally home, and I'd seen he was running late; I ditched the burner phone. If that would do any damage, it was done.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHe had a beautiful, well-kept lawn he mowed regularly; at least once a week I'd see him moving around as I walked by the Bastard's box to stick the mail in; frankly most blocks I never got out of the car, but the Bastard was one of a few I actually hand-carried the letters to. I knew I had to do something about that one; and quietly scattered a few invasive seeds into his yard as I walked; frankly I didn't even know what they all were, aside from the Kudzu. I even managed to spill some down my pants legs close to the house when I walked up to greet his wife. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHe had two dogs; both of them overpriced, expensive little devils. Poodles, I suspect; never cared much for dogs. At first, I wasn't going to do anything to them. Frankly, the wife seemed to like them more than he did. Eventually, I succumbed to temptation and poisoned them one day while the owners were out; a couple of hamburger patties stuffed with raisins. I was honestly surprised by how well that worked, even though the patties had sat in my truck for a few days before I had the opportunity to lay them out. Both dogs were gone by the end of the week; and the yard was looking like hell. Vines completely overgrowing the house, weeds everywhere; I hadn't intended it, but the Kudzu had actually spread into some of the neighboring yards. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhen the HoA sent him complaints in the mail, I tossed the first one. I was amused to see him spraying his house with weed-killer for the fiftieth time as I delivered a late notice about the neighbors complaining about the 'unkempt' state of his home. He looked a bit upset and frazzled. A few things had been going wrong, but not enough. I needed to do more. I knew he hadn't been married when he killed mom. Did the new wife know he was a killer?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI did some research. The man was a drunkard, and occaisionally violent; my mom's death was his third DUI. He'd never really been caught or convicted of anything else; honestly, it looked like that was all he had really done. But I didn't think that was enough. I picked out a few unsolved cases from his hometown; a rape, a burglary; and I put in the real, genuine convictions; none of which had resulted in much jail time. Looking through this paperwork, you could easily find corroborating evidence online or elsewhere for some of it; which would make the rest of it look truly convincing. If I hadn't put the paperwork together myself, I'd have thought he was a rapist, a thief, and a serial killer. At the end was a threat; that I knew about the little girl, and would release everything I knew to the cops if I weren't paid.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd, of course, I left it for the wife to find when she got home from work before him; which she always did; the insurance office she worked at shut down at four on the dot, every day; she'd get home, cook dinner; I must admit, I'd spied on her quite a few times, from a nearby park. Pretending to be bird-watching. Which is exactly what I was doing when she got home that day and found the bundle inside the house. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI got to watch her stunned disbelief as she fumbled through the papers through my binoculars. She slammed the door, and went upstairs; and I sat back on a bench, eating a sandwich. Throwing some bread to the birds. An hour later, when the Bastard got home, I wasn't able to watch that part for long; a few kids were playing in the park, and I needed to keep focusing on the trees to pretend I was birdwatching. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI saw him stepping out of the house only minutes after he walked in. The place was still covered with vines; he must've trimmed them completely the day before, or you wouldn't have even been able to open the door without tearing some of them out of the way. There was yelling. Screaming. And he got in the car and drove away. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWould that lead to a divorce? Maybe. Maybe not. But that wasn't really the objective. I'd seen him go on a few drinking binges before; he had his own favorite bar, and I'd even gone by and seen him there a few times; I wasn't a regular, but I knew the place; and especially enjoyed listening to his rants about how everything seemed to be going wrong. So this time, I got in the car; and I followed. I didn't go in with him; but I did break into his car through one of the rear windows. And when he finally slipped out of the bar, drunk and barely aware of himself, getting ready to drive off again.... I was in the back seat. Quiet. Slouched behind the driver's seat, holding a jagged chunk of window glass. As he turned down a long, winding road, heading back to the suburbs, barely managing to stay between the lines, I jammed the chunk of glass into his throat.\",\n",
