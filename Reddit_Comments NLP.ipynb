does eating out cause the restaurant employees to work? maybe causation extends to helping to create the reasons why that person works on the sabbath. well then why doesn\\'t it extend to the reasons for those reasons? pretty soon you realize that by choosing not to work on sabbath yourself, you are limiting the supply of employees willing to work on the sabbath, yet you are not necessarily reducing the demand for services on the sabbath (not everything works like a restaurant where you can simply not eat out on the sabbath. i\\'m thinking car insurance, apartment complex maintenance crews, blah blah), then you are helping to raise the wages for the sabbath hours and therefore helping to create reasons for people to work on the sabbath. uh-oh.\\n\\nso while i agree that causing someone to work on the sabbath would be bad according to old testament law, i don\\'t think that it\\'s actually possible to *make* someone work on the sabbath. i probably wouldn\\'t eat out anyway, but i would not claim that it was unlawful to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**boring stuff begins here**\\n\\njesus and the jews did not get along. he blatantly disobeyed jewish laws and did not respect the 2nd temple jewish leadership. he considered the pharisaic and sadducaic movements as a plague of sorts.\\n&gt; \"be careful,\" jesus said to them. \"be on your guard against the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees.\" they discussed this among themselves and said, \"it is because we didn\\'t bring any bread.\" aware of their discussion, jesus asked, \"you of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? do you still not understand? don\\'t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? how is it you don\\'t understand that i was not talking to you about bread? but be on your guard against the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees.\" then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees. - [matthew 16:6-12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2016:6-12;&amp;version=31;)\\n\\nhowever, it would be silly to think that jesus thought that judaism was completely and categorically wrong. jesus was a born a jew and taught his followers to worship the abrahamic (jewish) god. he quoted jewish scriptures, regarded the jewish temples as holy places, and followed many jewish traditions (e.g. passover). jesus and his disciples certainly did not consider themselves to be gentiles. the very idea of a messiah is a prophesy from the jewesh scripture of isaiah. when jesus went before pontius pilate he acknowledged that he was both a jew and the messiah in one short answer:\\n&gt;\"are you the king of the jews?\" asked pilate. \"yes, it is as you say,\" jesus replied. - [mark 15:2 (niv)](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=48&amp;chapter=15&amp;verse=2&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse)\\n\\njesus\\' disciples were also considered jews.\\n&gt;\"he called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness....these twelve jesus sent out with the following instructions: \\'do not go among the gentiles or enter any town of the samaritans.\\'\" - [matthew 10:1,5](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2010:1-5;&amp;version=31;)\\n\\njesus did not denounce all of judaism, but rather believed that 2nd temple judaism was a corruption of a true abrahamic faith. his teachings provide a \"correction\" of sorts. after all, the messaiah was to restore the jewish faith as well as israel\\'s rule. it wasn\\'t until jesus\\' death that jesus\\' followers (christians) desired to be separated completely from the jews. this is mostly due to christian criticism of the conduct of the sanhedrin (jewish court) where jesus was tried for blasphemy and, according to the gospels, eventually handed over to the romans to be crucified.\\n\\nsaying that christians are non-jews is like saying that supporters of ron paul are not americans. sure, his idea of what government should be is very different from what it is today. if he were to have his way then many american laws would be thrown out and much of our government would be dissolved. brand new legislation would also be passed. but that doesn\\'t mean that what\\'s left would no longer be america. ron paul argues the opposite. as a constitutionalist libertarian he believes he would simply be returning america to what the founding fathers meant it to be in the first place. in that sense, christians are most certainly jews.\\n\\n\\n**disclaimer**: i am not a christian and i do not personally believe that the jewish faith is corrupt or that christianity is better or more correct in any way. this is my understanding of the historical christian perspective. also, i am not comparing ron paul to jesus. that is simply an artifact of the analogy.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
