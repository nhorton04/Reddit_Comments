hscs from old mice showed increased activation of mammalian target of rapamycin mtor signaling compared to those from young mice intriguingly inhibition of mtor with the drug rapamycin reversed agingrelated declines in mouse hsc function and enhanced the ability of old mice to mount an effective immune response to infection with influenza virus the authors thus propose that manipulation of

rapamycin during infection can paradoxically induce a more effective memory t cell response      lowdose  inhibitor therapy in elderly humans decreased the incidence of all infections improved

common denominator of ageassociated frailty is increased baseline inflammation called inflammaging that is present in older individuals recent studies have shown that the presence of excessive inflammation can inhibit immunity in both animals and humans and that this can be prevented by blocking inflammatory processes this finding has important implications for the immunity of older

an engineering program for underrepresented and underserved people in stem and tech  i had a phenomenal team of other volunteers who helped but they stayed  quarters before moving on typical turnover rate a handful stuck around and were hired  a core part of the curriculum was the intangible skills such as persistence resilience curiosity grit opportunity identification and others these were taught through mentorship and a carefully crafted program that hid them under the surface of hardware engineering design and entrepreneurship   i forwent pay for those two years so that we could put more money into the program and because i wasnt doing it for money i was doing it because i hope to send off generations of global leaders in tech and business individuals who embody and perpetuate the ideal dream that we are all reaching for  nbsp  why i ask the question that i ask  i did not start volunteering at the nonprofit to save people i did it because i knew and grew up around east palo alto from the  and i always like to expand peoples worlds so many people i hung out with from there never saw stem or the high tech jobs that were right next door as an option it just didnt exist in their world also i did it because i was fortunate to be raised by parents who raised me in a multicultural community where there was never a question of diversity and inclusiveness it just was my first experiences with the fact that the world didnt run that way was when i stepped out of that community and it made me sad to see and determined to push us towards that ideal  im particularly good at the full stack of engineering leading and building when the admin team at the nonprofit saw how i worked and was able to do every aspect of what we were doing they asked me to build the engineering program as i saw fit i was super stoked  it was immediately a wild success and from  over  students came through the doors of that program alone and many volunteers from google facebook linkedin apple and even the military rd teams  nbsp  but  i saw so many more people come and join and immediately assume an administrator role they were too good to clean up or take out the trash they rapidly rose to a role that didnt require them helping people directly and instead allowed them to delegate or do outreach things that you do need a handful of people doing but not so many  to me it seemed like it may have unconsciously become a nice accolade or resume item but not so much an opportunity to truly and profoundly impact each and every life that came through that door  ive seen this many other places as well  nbsp  to me the students ages  see the way we act and interact with our environment and when they see that we have ownership of our building engineering design lab equipment when they see that we put in countless hours to keep things clean and nice and such that the students get the best experience every single day it communicates to them in profound and deep ways when we dont have that ownership they respond to that  it has always been a mantra of mine we leave the place as good if not better than when we got here my students learned that and would be given time to clean up and reorganize after a night of classes the other tracks in the program didnt do this their volunteers didnt do it and it came clear through how people felt about each respective track to me the leaders need to be willing to sweep up too   look no further than doug jones and joe reed for examples of people who were too high and mighty to clean the toilets or take out the trash those come from prior interviews by gimlet medias reply all team  nbsp   my wife is latin native american and caucasian i am a mixed mutt despite not looking like it  one of the first things she told me was that it was the mentors that she worked beside and who encouraged her who truly and profoundly impacted her life who were the ones who put the idea that she could go into a stem field into her head and ultimately lead her to drive towards a phd and get it  nbsp  in the midst of our personal and professional pursuits her and i have voluntarily and proactively done outreach events ranging from demonstrations to presentations that have gone incredibly well and touched communities who dont typically get attention from people from scientific engineering and entrepreneurial backgrounds  we both feel that its imperative to have the people promoting diversity and inclusiveness in stem also acting to make it a reality and not just being a figurehead thats good at getting attention although that helps  you can imagine my personal frustration at how many who are good at getting media attention arent actually spending the time on the front line making it a reality again dont get me wrong those people are a crucial component but what do those childrentoadults think when they see a figure head who isnt the one doing the work what message does that send  nbsp  three last items for clarity   the communities i was working with simply needed encouragement and the door to be open to them they are super smart innovative and talented and the local companies like facebook google etc really need to genuinely help them get their foot in the door these people are shining stars that simply need the platform to show what they are capable of   i am ignorant of who you are beyond the information that

like waiting 🤷\\u200d♂️ also thank you for your servicethat caught me off guard 😅 thanks for the reward kind stranger yall are very welcome i genuinely enjoy what i do 👍 whats been your weirdest encounter and also happy birthday wish you the bestwierdest encounter as in with a patient id need you to a be a bit more specific because ive seenheardobservered so much stuff throughout the years 😅 and that award was for being on the front line salutethanks kind stranger much appreciated 😌👍 happy birthday however tell us about the most karen patient you had to transportoh man i might have to come back to this one because somthing you need to learn right off the bat is to  have thick skin meeting people for the first time at a hospital is not ideal so if they give you attitude you wouldnt know if they were told  minutes ago by a doc that they have aggressive cancer as an example so many times you let shit slide  buuuuuuuuutttt the number of people ive brought up from the er to thier rooms because they are staying a night or more and they are unhappy because a the room is too small some are somewhat small or b there is not a nice view out the window  and only once have i had a patient absolutely not want to stay in a particular room that they signed a paper stating they are refusing medical treatment and they left eyup because of a room what a waste of time and resources precovid  ive got the same birthday as you happy birthdaywoop woop happy birthday ♌ 🥳🥳🥳 hows the bitcoin coming along ur  have you ever encountered someone with schizophrenia ps happy birthdayas far as i know negative unless its been written in thier charts but i dont think im allowed to fully read it i dont bother besides finding thier mrndobname 🤔 its my birthday today  but its coming to a close different time zones do you think youll have cake do you even like cake i didnt but i bought some goodies to share with my workmates tomorrowhappy birthday 🥳🎂🎂🎂🎂 uuhh hell yeah i will ice cream cake cookies and cream my fave i do hate fruits onin cakes lol they just dont go well together fight me lol you are a blessing for doing that i sure hope you had a wonderful day 😌🍻if you  drop your wishlist sensei wishlist  this covid shit would go away  to go to a fucking rave its my escape from life lol  fly to central america and see the fam  fly to space imagine how much of a mind fuck that would be hell yeah  sky dive  go to la vita barcongra room those clubs are my favorite and they are always a good time 😂 lacusc medical if i had to guess happy birthday   when transporting face shield and mask or just mask also gloves or no  negative but even if you guessed right i wouldnt say youre right lol  thank you much appreciated 👍  we are required to wear a mask at all time inside the hospital so theres that and i bought my own face shield so i wear them most of the time especially when in the er or if a patient has a breathing vent is intubated which we would also wear an  mask ass well  thats a tough one because the biggest thing you want to do is avoid any cross contamination and since i also move covid patients that something you really want to avoid  with that said some health guides and what we have been taught regarding ppe has changed once covid started i wont get into full details cause every once in a while it changes again and i dont want to give miss information regarding how we usedispose of said ppe  most of the timenow at least i do use gloves the entire time i transport but when i have to press buttonsuse my badge to access doors i use the backside of my gloved handthe nonleast contaminated side or my watch to get a hold of my badge or press say the elevator button this lowers the risk of spreading anything im sure i missed some stuff but im trying to get to eveylry question now if you have more ask away  my birthday is the  too how well does the job paywhen i started basepay was  ish morning and weekdays working mids and nights pays even more and working weekends adds to that  with my  years and usually working weekends im at around  ish now no hazard pay though  human logistics you poor bastard i thought being a courier was bad enough only live thing i transported was baby chickens to a teen ager for experiments so that was weird  i did move containers back and forth between hospitals and ivf facilities those folk have all the worst jokes i didnt even get a chance to make any of my ownhuman what lol honestly i love my job i get to see the ins and outs of a hospital ive seen some gnarly shit go down and the friends ive made are friends forever wouldnt change it until i get my xrayct license 😈  aaahhh shit to a teen yeaaaahhhh 😂😂  lmao in a place full of disease and sadness sometimes a bad joke to break the stress is just what you need 👍 lol but you gotta be quicker  exactly how patient are you  and thank you and happy birthdayhow patient am i  i watch youtube videos without skipping the ads  in all seriousness if you are going to deal with patients you need very thick skin so far not a single patient has gotten remotely close to getting any kind of attitude from me its been almost  years working  happy birthday man and also thanks for ur service my question is what was the age of the oldest patient u transported and how was himherthank you kind friend 😊  ooooooohhhhhh i would say somewhere around  nothing particularly interesting about that patient tbh just kind of there hate to say it but on their last moments imo  ive had many  year old who walk and talk as if they are still young hell just last week i admitted a  year old and this guy practically ran from the gurney into his bed 😂 i joked and said not to run away he replied with  i wouldnt want to embarrass security lmfao thats how i wanna be when im old 😂😭 happy birthday i am a nurse and we really appreciate you and your friendliness with the patients and your hard workand thank all you nurses for literally fighting this tough fight  i hope you are safe and stay safe during these times nurse and i wish safety for you and your colleagues 👏👏  personally i wouldnt be able to do what yall are doing i feel like i would get too attached to my patients and having to bag someone i got attached to is the biggest no no for me 😬 why cant u celebrate itbecause covid said fuck  and dodger stadium is closed where i wouldve been tonight behind home plate double fisting tall cans all night while enjoying dodger dogs 🤤🤤🤤  happy birthday  thank you for your work dont mention it i love what i do and it brings me joy when i see my patients leave the hospital hopefully i never see them again in the hospital 😅 happy birthdaythank you kind stranger 😊👍😌 happy birthday and thank you for being there helping first line

       "  'i learned how to lucid dream before i knew what lucid dreaming was  it started with flying when i was a child i wanted nothing more than the power of flight eventually it became a part of my dreams eventually it became all i ever dreamed about it was wonderful at first every night i would go to sleep hoping i could have the kind of freedom i could never have while awake but eventually my mind started to catch on  i would go to sleep and dream of flying then i would realize it was a dream and immediately wake up my waking hours were spent exhausted from lack of sleep after that started happening dream flight wake exhaustion dream flight wake exhaustion nearly every night that is until my mind started to become clever about these things instead of flying just flying it found ways to justify what i was experiencing it wasnt flight it was some kind of magic that allowed me to move through the air it wasnt flight it was a special bicycle that i could ride through the sky it wasnt flight it was swimming up gliding down anything i could use to trick myself into staying asleep longer anything i could use to keep myself from realizing i was in a dream  eventually my mind caught on to that too dream flight wake exhaustion dream flight wake exhaustion  i wonder what changed if it was because i was so physically tired that my body was forced into sleep regardless or if it was because somehow throughout all of this my mind was still trying to come up with some other ways to rationalize myself into remaining asleep but ill never forget the first night it happened the same pattern started i fell asleep started dreaming found myself in flight realized i was dreaming anddidnt wake up i almost did i could feel myself waking up that same jolt of realization that would typically leave me hyperventilating as i shot up in bed disappointed and unable to sleep for the rest of the night but this time i stayed asleep and i could still fly  things became more interesting after that i still dreamed of flying every night but as soon as it happened i would become lucid and could spend the rest of the dream in complete control well not always complete control as i became older i started dreaming of other things i experienced different types of lucid dreams the scale i usually use is awarenesscontrol lucidity isnt an on or off thing you see you can have a high controllow awareness dream where youre able to manipulate people and environments but you feel like a puppeteer in an empty world you never fully realize youre dreaming or you can have a high awarenesslow control dream where youre fully aware that youre in a dream but theres nothing you can do to change anything  sometimes its somewhere in the middle and those are always the dreams i find most interesting although theyre also the dreams that are typically the most frightening you see without full awareness or full control things can getweird   one of my favorite nightmares started normally at first but somewhere along the line i realized i was trapped inside a simulation along with the friends who were with me it didnt frighten me at first until i realized i couldnt escape i tried i would try to find glitches that i could exploit walls overlapping ceilings at unnatural angles a flower vase hovering over a table people clipping into floors but every time i thought i was free i would be met with another glitch and realize the true nature of my situation i always ended back where i started until finally some other force caught on that i was previously unaware of the true controller it was merely curious at first until it understood what i was attempting then there was anger it realized what i was doing and always stopped me it would tempt me and taunt me it would introduce glitches areas that i thought were outside of its omniscience something i could take advantage of but they were always traps and the more i struggled and fought the more it learned   i realized that something greater would be needed to defeat it the combined power of all human minds inside the simulation resisting at once overloading its control and breaking its illusion so we gathered and we fought every single one of us against what and how i dont quite know dream logic doesnt always make sense and then at the nearclimax of this great battle snap back to the beginning but different this time i called out to my friends what happened to us what happened to this world i was greeted by an empty shell it was like talking to an npc empty shells everyone all smiles and canned responses no memory no agency no mind and i realized i was alone entirely alone  the controller had fun with me after that i still tried to escape on my own but it had learned all my tricks it was angry before but it was laughing now it would introduce novel glitchesi still had hope at firstbut they would only serve to drive me into a deeper layer of the simulation i thought the glitches would be my escape and it mocked me for this now i couldnt escape the glitches until there was nothing but glitches all of reality breaking down around me until my body and mind were torn layer through layer the only thoughts and emotions remaining nothing but the purest panic  and then i woke up apparently i had worked myself up so much in the dream that it forced me awake and then i knew the true reality of the situation i could never escape the simulation because the dream was the simulation freedom could only come through waking up and leaving the simulationthe dreamentirely  i call these mixed awarenesscontrol dreams enough to know that something is off somehow and enough to have some degree of control over such an unnatural situation   theyre my favorite kind of lucid dream  ive been sleeping a lot recently its hard to get out of bed most daysthings have been hard recentlyand leaving this hopeless world for one of infinite possibilities is a temptation ive found less and less reason to resist ive had all kinds of lucid dreams but theyve always been our own i think   i wonder what other kinds of lucid dreams there are i wonder whos dream i could find myself in  this mor

       "  'like all biological determinist research  suffers from a host of problems that render any conclusions based on it regarding the possible genetic basis of specific psychobehavioral traits unwarranted below i will discuss some of the problems i noticed based on a cursory review in no particular order   nbsp  first it is important to remember that there is no reliable scientific evidence that specific psychobehavioral traits in humans have particular consistent genetic underpinnings what the available evidence instead shows is that rather than biology these traits derive their specific features from sociocultural and politicaleconomic environmental factors according to the evidence biology merely serves as a general potentiator of psychology and lacks a specific deterministic or even influential role in this regard indeed virtually all psychological traits eg selfconcept emotions motivation memory perception sexuality exhibit culturallyspecific features   in line with this given that the author take an evolutionary perspective and hypothesizes that concealed mating evolved as the norm in humans p  which is to say that he assumes this norm is biologically determined his findings are dubious in  cultural psychologist carl ratner elucidates why biological determinist theoretical orientations in the social sciences such as evolutionary psychology are untenable  it takes thousands of generations for genetic changes to accumulate via a sufficient number of organisms outreproducing other organisms to produce a new morphology yet humans have produced only  generations since the founding of the roman empire this is not enough time for new morphology to genetically evolve and human behavioral change does not involve morphological changes in genes neurotransmitters or cortical structures which obviates genetic evolutions pertinence to human behavior at all naturalistic theories of human psychology such as evolutionary psychology are false p  bold and italics added  nbsp  second the study relies on surveys which are generally unreliable due to complications including the  and  in fact the author admits that since informants are often reluctant to discuss their sexual lives    sexual aspects are often poorly documented and that informants may not practise liberal sexual behaviours in the presence of anthropologists that come from cultures where such behaviours are strongly disapproved of while he states that sufficient ethnographic data on the privacy of legitimate mating were found p  he apparently fails to elaborate on the criteria that qualify this data as sufficient these limitations and weaknesses are clearly considerable and do not exactly inspire confidence in the authors findings   nbsp  third the author states that idespread human behaviours are strong candidates for evolutionary adaptations p  however this claim is misleading in order to consider whether specific psychobehavioral traits are biologically determined evolutionary adaptations it is insufficient that they be merely widespread they must also be universal this is because a biologically determined traits in species do not exhibit crosspopulation variability and b widespread historicallyspecific sociocultural and politicaleconomic factors can potentially account for widespread behaviors in humans even so just like correlation ≠ causation universal ≠ biological indeed correlational evidence such as that presented in this study lacks the power to establish causation as i explain    in order to determine whether some variable x causes another variable y y causes x some third variable z causes both x and y or the association between x and y is merely incidental experiments are necessary this is a basic principle of research  while this research may certainly suggest genetic underpinnings to this concealed mating norm it by no means confirms their existence that is it does not amount to reliable scientific evidence that such underpinnings actually exist   it is scientifically irresponsible to conclude a genetic basis to widespread or even universal psychobehavioral traits prior to investigating and ruling out possible environmental causes i explicate on this point  with regard to homosexuality but it equally applies to all other psychological traits psychosexual or otherwise   your main problem here is in conceiving behavior in abstract general terms this gives the impression of universality when there in fact may be none in  cultural psychologist carl ratner discusses why this is problematic    in contrast with physical abstractions which provide essential information about gravitation floatation waves and gases abstract psychological notions about thinking memory feeling and learning are rather barren psychological abstractions usefully indicate the general aspects of human activity—especially in contrast to animal behavior—however they never reveal its particularity and variety as clifford geertz  chap  argues generalities such as man thinks man is moral man enjoys beauty man has kinship systems man uses language people have a sense of time humans categorize information are neither false nor unimportant however they fail to disclose the richness of the concrete particular instances from which those generalities are derived p          what we know for certain is that specific concrete psychobehavioral traits exist so occams razor would select for this conception of traits as concrete in favor of the notion that traits falling under some abstract category are materially related in order to support this latter claim scientific investigation into the matter is necessary as ratner continues       we cannot assume a more general level of explanation until more specific levels have been systematically ruled out if specific sociotechnological factors can plausibly account for psychological phenomena it is unwarranted to postulate universal factors for example the trobriander islanders sophisticated logical inference can plausibly be explained by their complex system of property rights and legal negotiation if their logical reasoning is found to be comparable to modern americans which we must emphasize has not been proven the explanation would lie in comparable formal features of the two social systems—ie in their individualized form of property allocation and their legal system of arbitration the trobrianders legal system having been imposed during their colonial period by the british and australian governments psychological similarities between the two peoples should not be attributed to abstract universal social features unless the formal features can be shown to be insufficient explanations ibid p   the author while interestingly listing qualitative variations in concealment p  nevertheless relies on an abstract conception of this behavior and fails to systematically rule out possible environmental confounds this further testifies to the unreliability of his conclusions   nbsp  fourth the author compares human behavior to that of nonhuman animals however as i elaborate  such comparisons are fallacious specifically they are    we cannot make any reasonable conclusions about human behavior based on animal studies this is precisely what stimulated the httpsenwikipediaorgwikihumanisticpsychology which took issue with behaviorists reliance on animal studies as humanistic psychologists note behaviorists downplayed ignored or even outright denied unique aspects of human behavior such as our free will and desirecapacity for personal growth humans are the only species capable of abstract and symbolic cognition as well as the only one able to organize complex societies unlike in other animals specific human behaviors generally have sociocultural rather than biological origins aside from things like the diving and suckling reflexes humans do not have instincts so to draw conclusions about human behavior based on studies of species that are largely instinctual would be whats called overextrapolation',\n",

massive building diego looked around the room once more as he saw the ripple he looked to the ceiling so far above that clouds formed on most days   today was no exception and they dimmed the stark white light trying to shine through them and illuminate more ripples in the water far below  diego took a deep breath withdrawing his sunglasses from a pocket and quickly putting them on no number of years ever made this less anxiety inducing  the ripples in the water increased and a fountain of water followed in the wake of he by whom we live shooting into the air before four of his massive arms came to a rest at the edge of the pool the fountain of water and the countless droplets of water that had shot into the air stopped  four great eyes like lighthouses shone with a sickly green light upon diego as thoughts like words trickled into his head  in an age long forgotten in an act that mortals would attribute to any number of more pleasant entities i stole fire from the heavens and gave it to man so that the gods may watch the earth be cleansed in a perfect fire by their very creations  despite the light shining down upon him diegos eyes went wide as the realization hit him his lord never lied as the truth was the greatest weapon against kings and gods alike   my lord on behalf of us all you have our eternal thanks he said with a small reverent bow  the lights narrowed diego shivering slightly with the cold their increased intensity brought the thoughts of his lord once again worked their way into his mind  fire is not the only element i have mastered let it be known that i shall impart the terrible power of ice unto the minds of mortals the depths bring the fires of a living planet breathing its terrible heat and the icy cold embrace of its darkest waters i gave you fire and you wrought engines of steel and nuclear flame i give you ice and the world shall know the horrible power of cold nuclear power eternal  diego trembled slightly receiving these thoughts was always a harrowing experience that was until a realization hit him a realization made possible only by he by whom we lives prior benevolence  my lord he spoke cautiously thinking over what he had heard carefully youdo you speak of cold fusion i thought it a fantasy  you are correct soon the world shall know ice wreak as much havoc as his brother fire  the thoughts flooded into diegos mind but

light was more focused  this will benefit humanity greatly my lord with cold fusion alone we may never need to worry about power again and the other implications if im understanding the power of ice correctly mean that  diego was interrupted by a sound unlike any other no not a sound the thought of a sound broadcast to every living thing in ten thousand fathoms the thought of an eldritch seabeast calling into the deep with naught but its own terrible voice to answer as it echoed among canyons and caves inconceivable in scope to those of dry land  this pleases you all of you  nnot all my lord there shall be some erbusinessmen who will not be happy that energy will be cheap and readily available diego quickly tried to soothe the concerns of his lord however incomprehensible they may be to him  and what of the beggars the serfs those who dare to dream and cast off the shackles of the circumstances of their births and topple kings and gods alike  their lives will again be improved greatly sir diego assured the ancient aberration of the depths putting on his best and brightest smile to match his lords seemingly endless teeth  again   his lords eyes narrowed and diego could see his breath illuminated sickly green as he appreciated the foresight of his morning self for wearing a woolen base layer under his fine suit  of course my lord you once again grace us with your benevol  he was cut off by that same terrible psychic wail the droplets of water that had been held in the air for far too long remembered the pull of gravity as they once again fell though only for a moment in the next moment they were pulled into a great swirling tide around the body of he by whom we live impossible streams of water flowing in impossible angles among the impossible geometries of his form  i struck down the plagues of the gods and gave you the forbidden gift of knowledge to bastards i would give the titles of men i elevated cripples and beggars to the level of kings your very kings lay dead as slaves were freed and housed in palaces and you call this benevolence  diego thought for a moment carefully mulling over his lords frustrations in his head for as long as he could before he responded my lord you cured all diseases i myself was on my deathbed in the prime of my life when you first emerged from the sea homeless were housed and orphans alike were housed and given a new lease on life i admit i was one of many scared at first when you first laid claim here as you got rid of many a corrupt  the psychic scream rang out again to interrupt diego who remained thankful that the sheer size of this room took up most of its range while wiping a bit of blood from his nose  it was only a momentary interruption as he pulled the crayon drawing from his pocket   henrys daughter wanted me to present this to you my lord he lives because of your banishment of disease and as a result of your mandatory rigorous education she even wants to be a scientist he said holding the crude drawing out to the ancient entity crayon lines and shading futilely attempting to replicate the subtle curves of parallel lines that crossed into one another and the robust majesty of perpendiculars that never met  four viridescent beams focused on the paper illuminating it and nothing else as the pale lights far above the clouds dimmed  see that the girl becomes a physicist the folly of man begs for knowledge forbidden and women may rise to the occasion and cast off the shackles of family  the water swirling around his great and terrible form quietly and orderly were drawn back into the pool  of course my lord i shall do so after i announce your newest act of malice to the world diego said with another small bow while still holding the crayon drawing aloft  tell them the gift of ice shall be delivered unto my houses of education immediately all shall know of its forbidden power i also require one final thing for today speaker  the beams of light moved from their laser focus on the drawing to diego once more widening to a far less intense flood of green  yes lord he asked  place the offering with the others at my shrine   the lights moved to a small stone building at the corner of the room only for a moment as he by whom we live withdrew into the water with ethereal grace the surface returning to that of a perfect mirror immediately as the last of his long claws vanished beneath the water  diego let out a long breath pausing only for a moment as the day was still long he quickly walked over to the small stone building finding its interior dimly lit in a similar pale white light as the main lights far above the larger room within he saw the usual countless letters and trinkets of varying sizes that he by whom we live had received as thanks over the years diego found a place on a board and pinned the drawing  the speaker had much to do today still but he had to linger for a moment and hope that his lord was finally starting to understand the good he had done for this world  made a few minor edits to clean up grammar i hope you enjoy',\n",

       "  'most people would say that im lucky most people would say they wish they were me most people would try and use it to their advantage i am not most people my family has always been big not in terms of body but rather people from a very young age the family teaches you that you can rely on each other trust each other and even call upon each other what they dont tell you until youre old enough is that its a requirement i wish i could turn down my family when they ask me to come teach them self defense i wish i could tell them im busy with other things i wish i could have a day off but i cant because my skill is useful  nbsp    you see in the family everyone has something theyre amazing at when youre young you think that its going to be your choice and youll get better at whatever it is you like but youre wrong when anyone in the family reaches the age of fifteen they get start their transformation this isnt a natural transformation its an abomination the family starts giving you the serum in your food before you even know whats happening to you it doesnt take long for the changes to begin and it feels kind of cool in the beginning suddenly youre discovering abilities you didnt know you had and you feel like you can do anything even if it stopped here thatd be fine but it never does  nbsp    the next step of the process comes a year or so later depending on how quickly youre changing thats when the injections start i still remember my first one it was terrifying my family sat me down in the lab the chair digging into my legs and the lights blinding me from above and told me they had to explain some things a quick video many angry questions and a few terrible explanations later i had a rough idea what had been happening to me there was a problem with the first serum it made you reasonably good at many tasks rather than extremely good at one task i cried out begging and pleading that they leave me alone i just wanted to stay myself who i had always been but they wouldnt allow it my cousins swarmed me each of them grabbing my body and holding me still forcing me to watch as the needle came closer and closer to my body when it pierced my skin i felt pain but i had no idea what was in store the plunger pushed down spreading the new serum into my blood and wracking my body with agony it was as if someone had poured hot lava into my veins then added a kick of hot sauce for fun i would be lying if i said i remembered all of it since i passed out but i remember enough  nbsp    eventually it doesnt make sense to fight against them no matter how far you run or how well you hide they find you and bring you back thats the problem with having a family full of specialists hunting you down theres no way for you to succeed instead i accepted my fate took the pain and used it as a motivator to find my revenge the second serum forces a change within you that turns you into a specialist but no one can predict what youll specialize in every time they injected me i wished for something useful there were a few cousins that were great at things like origami brushing hair and spelling things backwards you can see why i was afraid luckily i ended up having one of the most useful skills you could get both a blessing and a curse  nbsp    one day when they were strapping me down to inject me my cousin was squeezing my wrist too tightly i warned him to stop even gave him a few chances but when he didnt listen my body reacted on its own my wrist twisted on the other side of my body releasing itself from the much weaker grip of the cousin on that side and flew across my chest when it smacked him in the cheek i was just as surprised as everyone else but it was even worse when my foot came up and kicked him his nose shattered and blood spurted out of his nose coating his clothes and landing on the floor when he eventually woke up he was dazed and lost for quite some time and the event was completely scrubbed from his mind from that point forward i took my injections with my mind focused on increasing my skill honing me into a force that couldnt be ignored  nbsp    as i said this ended up being a curse another fucked up part of being in this family is the implant theres an implant they place at the base of your skull that forces you to accept requests that make it through the system luckily there are strict regulations around those requests but still means that you are constantly busy well youre busy if you have a useful skill in my case i never had free time of my own except when my free time was scheduled if you reject too many requests without a good reason the implant injects you with a painful chemical that encourages you to change your mind the strongest people in the family can only reject three or four requests before theyre begging for mercy their cries for help incoherent and agonizing at that point one of the older cousins will request an easy request from them just to get the neutralizing injection if youre not careful though the easy request will never come youll be left alone with your misery wasting away in the lab or your familysponsored housing  nbsp    which brings us to today today is the day that i fight back after a decades of slaving for this family most of which was never repaid in kind i break free you might guess that im going to get the implant removed but i cant maybe you think ill try and fake an injury but they would know no its much simpler than that im going to kill my cousins every single one of them you might think it impossible especially with a family as large as mine but you would be wrong just like everyone else in the family you think their numbers make them invincible but thats actually their weakness for years i have been twisting situations and building conflict guiding each and every one of my family members into a war they didnt know existed resentment has grown and festered transforming into a terrible creature that none of them can recognize the family love has been stripped down ripped apart and used as ammunition against them all of it every bit of the preparation ive done comes down to one thing the death of the leader  nbsp    in our family the leader is a single person that has control of the family no matter what type of cousin you are you have to listen to the whim of the leader as a result its an understandably coveted position i have been weaving the relationships of my blood to all think they have a chance at being the next leader or at least supporting the one who will become it silently factions have been forming and preparing spying and gossiping training and sabotaging none of that matters as long as the leader still lives and our current leader is quite young if i had to guess he would likely live longer than me and i cant wait any longer his life is the only life i need to take and the rest will fall to the floor lost within the chaos of greed and revenge  nbsp

       "  'as i looked up hearing the clanking of metal i noticed the stranger looming above me the armor was old really old outsiders werent common in a village this far out from anything close to a large civilization but they did come every once in a while the face was obscured by a metal visor with vertical slots cut into it so that the wearer could see on the top of the helmet they wore a faded red feather popped out dancing in the gentle breeze   hello i said cautiously the silence was a tad unsettling   greetings the deep voice boomed i could now tell that it belonged to a man ive come to recruit peasants to accompany me on my journey  peasants an odd choice of words but the aura surrounding him screamed odd i looked at the rest of him he wore armor to match his helmet medival style gauntlets boots and breastplate a semi automatic pistol was snugly fitted in a leather holster resting on his left hip all of his outfit was made from some sort of silver metal though i couldnt tell what material it was exactly i was a farmer not a blacksmith   right i extended a hand well my name is neil ill  neil he yelled interrupting me a valiant name for a valiant man he shook my hand vigorously the metal from the gauntlet burning me we were in the desert and the sun was especially brutal today i wondered how on earth he stayed cool in the suit of armor the man must have been a walking oven  ill show you to the main square where you can introduce yourself to everyone else i finished ignoring his compliment   the man turned heads but not in a good way as we walked towards the square once we arrived he found a stack of food ration crates in a shaded corner then dragged one out near the old well in the center of the village i turned to get back to work in the fields when he shouted for everyones attention the few people occupying the square turned took one look at the strange figure clad in armor then returned to whatever they were doing before he didnt seem to care and began shouting anyway i stopped and listened slightly amused   greetings fine people of this village he began i am sir herald i have come to you with a request centuries ago in the age of sword and steel the world was chaotic and dangerous but a group of heroes saved it and battled back their evil foes today the world is more lawless than ever i believe that we can once again restore peace to the land and create a safer world    by the end of his small speech a crowd of people had gathered around him when he stepped down from the box of rations he was standing on  they laughed       some shouted fool others idiot along with a slew of other even less polite insults they continued jabbing at him as he walked through the crowd standing tall heading towards me     sir neil herald said the local population seemed to not enjoy my speech     no indeed i mumbled eager to leave before more of my friends and neighbors saw me conversing with a lunatic still i felt a strange pang of guilt for wanting to leave him as crazy as he was he seemed like a nice enough person listen i think that you might have better luck recruiting or whatever somewhere else i pulled out a map i always kept in my back pocket in the event that i got lost for some reason or another i pointed to a miniscule black dot in the middle of the american midwest this is a town called unggoiye its small but big enough to be charted its just a hundred or so miles south from here you might find some potential people there  herald laughed and slapped me on the back hard i tensed then recognized the gesture as a friendly one not one of attack   good thinking sir neil he boomed we shall go to this unggoiye and find more suitable canidates to join us    us i repeated im not going   of course you are this occasion gave me a name for you sir neil the humble  im not going i repeated firmly   herald sighed in defeat i was hoping that you wouldnt say that well i appreciate your hospitality even if it was short lived i shall carry on the will of arthur on my own for the time being then  will of arthur   yes herald lit up again i was pretty certain that he had waited to bring up whoever this arthur was to recapture my attention   i shall explain for you sir neil herald said long ago there was a king he travelled the land and fought for all that was good    is that the hero you mentioned     one of them yes king arthur and his knights of the round table     arthur is a legend along with his knights     herald seemed to be expecting this comment maybe so but what they represented is very true indeed i aim to fulfill the will of arthur and gather my own knights together we will form a new round table and fight for good in this new age     i recoiled a bit every hope i had in herald was lost i felt bad for the man however the speech wasnt an act he really believed he could gather a bunch of other knight wannabes and fight for good one step in the wrong direction one conversation with the wrong person and he could end up dead he was too hopeful too optimistic      well it was good to make your acquaintance sir neil i will pray that our paths cross again in the future herald bowed curtly then walked south down the dirt road        i thought about herald the rest of the day then at night i barely slept pondering about him i tried to forget but he continued to stick in my mind that morning i made a decision     i grabbed my travel pack and stuffed it with the essentials laced up my hiking boots and set off south towards unggoiye       this would have been a lot better if i had taken the time to polish it so sorry its just a first draft but it is just a prompt this is my first submission on this subreddit and i would appreciate any honest feedback you could give me',\n",

       "  'an inability to follow sound advice thats what id say was the root cause i said but the immediate cause was a large dose of warp venom i work as a guide not a bodyguard  and you justtook her stuff off her corpse and left her there  you ever seen the aftereffects from huge quantities of warp venom there wasnt much corpse left and the armor was going pretty quick as well what else am i going to do find her next of kin figure out whatever bunker she was from and make the journey no ill take what payment i can get and come back to my farm  he sighed which made him sound like a gust of wind trying to work its way through a loose metal pipe well anyway like i said im on a mission of grave importance to the whole human race and  whole human race i interrupted slightly savoring the sort of face i knew hed be making under his helmet you mean some particular goal of the leadership of your particular bunker i see no reason i should be beholden to the whims of some aging bunkie farts still all puffed up with old world ideological grandiosity  he tensed gripping his beam rifle very hard and audibly stressing the joints of his armor grandiosity neolibertarian postevangelical reformed stewardship is humanitys only viable path forward after the apocalyptic collapse to assist the cause of nelpers is to assist the entire species and i  i snapped my fingers making a coruscating bluelight boom from the builtup energy in my hand he staggered back and fell on his metalclad ass but more importantly shut up for the moment  like i said ive heard the speech before its basically the same for every one of you no matter what you call your ideology so tell you what today i got plowing to do tomorrow also and the next day but come back after that and we might be able to work out an arrangement if your attitude of entitlement improves that is and youre willing to agree to some fair profitsharing terms  profit he screeched rocking back and forth a few times before he hand the momentum to regain his feet with all the weight he was wearing i managed to suppress another laughthe energy from my little snap would have momentarily disabled all the servos and pullfibers in his suit nothing forces a little humility on a person like a sudden forty kilos of dead weight  profit i answered mildly and glared at my plow until it turned around to start moving back toward me farming keeps my family fed but a little cash on the side is needed for a real living  this is a mission for needed parts and artifacts to advance the cause he continued and i wondered how badly his vocal hysterics must be bouncing around inside that can on his head served him right its not about profit  i sighed they really dont do a good job preparing some of you for the outside world do they i suppose it makes sense for the first one they send out youve all been in there smelling your own dogmatic farts for so long  he raised the beam rifle to point at me and i put up my hands not for the reason he thought partly it was just exasperation id been hoping hed see some kind of reason i could have used some extra cash at the time and while it looked like i was about to have some salvage to sell i really would preferred to earn it in a less distasteful fashion  but i muttered the twisting phonemes of the reversal hex under my breath anyway got do do what you got to do  wasteland native i am conscripting you in the cause of humanity he said with a clearly carefullyrehearsed flourish you will come to see the wisdom and necessity of this in time i require a guide to the columbian valley and you will take me there or suffer the sad consequences  yeah i will i said  he relaxed just a bit well glad youre seeing reason now let us be off theres no time to waste on this mission  no i meant ill suffer the sad consequences i said but thats your choice not mine  i kept my hands up though necessary got to keep the energies flowing  he just stood there and stared at me  not going to actually do anything i asked then go back to your bunker leave me and the rest of the village alone none of us will be willing to help you after youve made threats like that and youd be wise never to come back  insolence he yelled you dare stand in the path of true progress  then he shot me  it formed a nice acute angle when it hit the hex which id tilted upward for safetys sake didnt want any part of the village hit with what the bunkies called collateral damage he stared up at the beam passing over his head and then i canted the hex back downward  once his head was gone he released the trigger and i dropped the ward  well i said watching the metalclad corpse hit the freshlyplowed soil that went about as well as could be expected all things considered at least i wont have to try and sell that stupid helmet even most bunkies wouldnt want a respirator that rattles like that  i raised my head and yelled back toward the house letting the warp radiation amplify and guide my voice through the air boys kendra gonna need your help with some salvage wont take but a minute    come on by rmagleby for more elaborate lies',\n",

       "  '  allen pushed on his lower back and looked up at the sun  it was another blisteringly hot day out in the middle of the ocean but he knew he was making a positive impact granted the task before him was so over the top that it probably wouldnt be fixed in his lifetime  but at least the plastic and detritus he was helping to pull out of the ocean today wouldnt kill the fish of tomorrow  he bent back to his work of wrangling the various over sized objects the collection buoy and gathered up  as he was attempting to shove a chair rapped in a fishing net into the sack a shadow passed over him looking up in confusion for just a moment ago there wasnt a cloud in the sky he was momentarily rendered speechless for improbably hovering above him was what for all intents looked like a giant plastic milk crate  as his brain finally rebooted and convinced its self that it was seeing shit and that was some really good weed it had just got done smoking frank stumbled into him    dude what the hell is that thing frank stammered  wait you see that too i thought it was just a figment of my imagination  allen responded as above the two of them a section of the crate detached its self from the structure and started to make its way down to them    frank what the hell is going on quick get the captain on the radio call home base do something  frank ran off in search of somebody to make responsible for this problem  leaving allen all alone on deck as the floating piece came to rest on the water next to him and a section of the wall in front of him irised open  to revile two things very not of this planet  they waved several appendages at him as a ramp extended onto the deck right in front of allen as they walked across the ramp one of the creatures waved a milk jug in allens general direction and a odd blue green light passed over him  at this allens rather overly abused brain kicked the fight or flight button and he started to back away from what ever it was that was happening  but before he got five steps one of the things in front of him spoke    greetings allen we are xlkrx from a far off planet we do not intend you harm  we are what you would call merchants we are here to trade for your plastic my name is xrlk and i look forward to striking a bargain with you for all of this amazing product you have laid out behind you     you want the plastic inquired a rather startled allen so started in fact that he failed to run away from the aliens and instead started to walk towards them      yes you have some of the highest quality plastic in some of the largest quantities we have ever seen in all our years of searching the galaxy we will happily trade you for it xrlk responded and he walked over to the sack allen had been filling moments ago    how much of it do you want and what do you want to trade for it blurted out a startled allen whos brain was starting to see a potential solution to a rather massive problem      well for starters we would take this patch off of your hands for say our knowledge of space travel and an introduction for you to the galactic government  their a rather stingy bunch what with the got to protect the primitive civilizations and what not but you humans havent managed to blow your selves up yet so im sure theyd be happy to add you to the roster of species  xrlk said as his still un introduced partner scanned the plastic with its milk jug and clicked and screeched something at xrlk    well that sounds like a fairly reasonable exchange responded allen however we do have additional stock if your think what is present here wouldnt be enough for your needs     we did notice that as we were scanning your planet earlier  and i was rather hoping youd bring it up we would gladly take it all of your hands right now for the equivalent of fifteen trillion of your euros    well that is a rather tempting offer however it seems like you have a great need for this plastic  what would you say if i provided you with a quantity of plastic each of our years for say eighteen trillion euros      what kind of quantity are you talking about here  xrlk inquired we have many uses for this product and do indeed require vast sums of it    if you would agree to split that money across each person on the planet  i think we could provide you with  to  million tons of plastic a year  allen responded     upon hearing this xrlks companion appeared to faint dead away  xrlk looked flabbergasted and allen took a perverse satisfaction in finally abusing somebody elses brain for once today  as the xlkrx pulled them selves back together and appeared to hold a conference with a six pack ring frank arrived and allen filled him in on what was happening and told him to just sit back and let him handle this      friend allen  i feel i must tell you that the volume of plastic you propose for this transaction is staggering and may vary well collapse the galactic plastic market  this of course would not be in your favor could we we perhaps acquire  million tons of plastic each year and you store the rest of that for a later time  a very flustered looking xrlk inquired    as allen realized just how staggeringly vast the waste of his fellow humans was he hoped that with their new found wealth and knowledge they would be about to find better ways to deal with storing things in the short term  and yet he knew that that would be a very tough battle      alright xrlk how about earth provides  million tons of plastic each year for sixteen trillion euros and we auto renew the contract each year

       "  ' i am hazy from how dirty the air is in here cigarette smoke hovers still in the air and i feel sick there is a smell of blood and it clings onto my skin i can feel it trying to break in though trying to loosen the gears in my head i resist however because this is just not the time i can see his eyes through the haze in the room i can tell he lost this particular battle and as he lets out yet another puff of smoke from his mouth i can tell that i will lose this battle too it was just a matter of time  remember when you used to insist we paint the walls like every two weeks over and over like a child who wants cake ha cake i could go for some cake right now or just go to cindy she used to make the best cakes i have ever heard    he is talking to me but not to me his eyes wander around the room   im going to open the window i say trying to sound nonchalant even though i needed him to give me his permission he goes on though like i had not said anything  theres this time we had your birthday you remember like three years ago and we invited her to come make the cake in our house you acted as if it was a surprise but i knew you knew linnie didnt either and she knew you so well but i knew it was easy to tell it was surprising no one could tell but i did and cindy did too she told me after and we laughed and laughed and then two years later after weve built this this magnificent life  his expressions were raw unfiltered he does not let himself cry even though he is this close to crying he takes a deep puff of his cigarette and i repeatim going to open the window i try to be a bit more aggressive but a bit of my fear seeps out and he throws me a look that shows me hes picked up on it   he grunts and he stomps down with all his might i cant feel it on my feet though most of the shock is absorbed onto the body his foot was on already there is a squishy sound instead and i gag a bit now i need the window open i move suddenly towards the nearest one to the left and his voice booms through this tiny living room i swear to god i will shoot your knees and rip out your tongue when youre looking at me this is the least you can do  i stop and i look at him and the gun in his hand is directly pointed to me and his trigger finger  is already wellpositioned and my fear gives way and i bend over and all the lunch i had before comes gushing out of me a new smell permeates the room and through the smoke i can see him smile  thats the way hold it in he takes another deep puff and continuesand then let it go and he lets the smoke in his lungs out through his nose and he laughs by himself and i am revolted   do what you want to do i say there is no bravery in my voice but there is a resolution i am going to die and it will be underserved and there was little i can do about  oi shut up i can hear you talking he says that and stomps on the body again the hair on her head moves unnaturally as it lightly bounces up then down its as if only her hair gains its life then loses it immediately  i look at him damn it of course he can we had been friends for a long time of course he can tell he can tell i am talking to all of you right now  he pushes himself from the wall he was leaning on and he stands his entire  frame glaring at my  frame i knew he was big but was he always this big   what are you telling them he asks youre lying to them arent you  what i say out loud and my heart beats faster than usual and i can tell the inevitable is closer now what are you talking about man i am this close to pleading and i do not want to go that way   cindy she always told me not to trust you she could always tell when something was off  what is off right now is you waving that thing at me dude chill i was getting desperate you literally stomped on her right now with the way she is right now i wonder if hes ever killed before ive known him my whole life and right now i was not sure dude just let me talk for a few seconds christ  what is it youre telling them the gun is pointing to me again i try to move back but my footing is slightly off i look down on the ground and notice that i had already stepped on the gunk that came out of me a few seconds ago i have no time to be disgusted   they dont know whats going on i swear they dont know they just know youre smoking cigarettes and you have a gun  i bet they think i killed cindy right  well i dont know do they   do you  no time to listen he stomps on the body again kicks it and he growls fucking bitch i cant believe this shit  he always never swore this was bad  she left me like everyone always does  he is now moving towards me with intent my time is growing shorter i feel like peeing all of a sudden and i realize thats what happens in movies im the guy who pees in the murder scene jesus i want to laugh i look at his face and his smile is even larger i cup my mouth with my right hand and i was laughing already loudly i can feel a bit of wetness underneath so i figure i have actually peed on myself i laugh even harder  he is now right in front of me his hands are already on my neck i look at the body in front of me and i remember he had kept kicking it i want to tell him to not kick me after i die but no words come out no air comes in either the pain registers slowly and it takes time to notice my palms are on his hands squeezing and trying to remove his hands from my throat i briefly black out and suddenly i can breath and the moment i can open my eyes i see him on the ground writhing in pain   i cough painfully i can feel some form of imprint of his hands on my neck whats going on i look at his face and there is a pen lodged in his eye he is screaming and both his hands are on his face he is shouting things i cannot understand like cindy im sorry i am so sorry oh god is this more painful because i am a christian if you stabbed me in the back that would be more ironic right  i ignore everything he is saying because if both hands are on his face then none of them are on the gun i look around wiping the tears that are on my face so i can see better i can see it to his left his body takes up most of the space of this apartment so i have to stand and stumble over him so i can grab the gun he rolls a bit and the moment i have it he makes a swipe at me but misses and i end up near cindys body   i dont know if you can see him as clearly as i can but i know you would have thought this moment glorious   he is still on the ground and i need his attention now so i fire a shot to the ceiling the sound is immediately followed by a loud grunt and a thud shit i think this is an apartment and we are not on the top floors   oh well problem for another day   for now it seems i have his attention the pen i must have lodged in him is now on the ground and his left hand cover the left eye that was wounded he is still his eyes not on me but the gun   i smile i look at the body next to me and i feel euphoric i can finally have my revenge this body lying here deserves some form of justice  i point the gun to him and he looks on bravely it ticks me off so i swing the gun towards the dead body and i fire the shot is muffled by the dead body but it is loud enough to muffle his sudden scream  i point it to him again and he goes still again  shut up he says and i become still jesus shut up you and her talk all the time blah blah blah blah god its like you just cannot stop i shoot the body again aiming right for the head and this time he lunges at me i quickly point the gun at him again and he goes still again he was close very close to me though i need to rethink the distance between us  the way she liked you it was so surreal like a movie you could say and it was so touching how youre here going crazy because i didnt tell them i killed her  he looks on and he looks way more sane than before he opens his mouth as if to say something then closes it he opens it again and closes it again and then he keeps it closed  i know what he wants to say though why  and i want to answer him oh so badly but before i do he takes the pen next to him and shoves it into his throat right into his jugular   and i drop the gun and i am shaking and i run to him i kneel next to him and there is so much blood and i do not know what to do i cannot remove the pen but there was blood still flowing from there i try use my fingers to cover it up and there is nothing i can do   i did it for you i say my hands still aimlessly looking for something to do she wasnt good for you i swear his own hands are now on his own neck and i hover my hand on top of his this was for you you werent supposed to be here you werent supposed to know  as i talk his left hand moves fast removing the pen from his throat and now the drip becomes a river and i am crying like a child   in his last moments i tell him over and over that i did not tell you guys that he killed her that i did not lie that i loved him and for all the people who called him a monster for his size that maybe the real monster was the only friend he made along the way ',\n",

       "  'they were my children budding and young growing up to be such wonderful creatures while in the early days they had fallen victim to superstition and infighting with a few minor adjustments and gifts from above they had surpassed such nonsense a golden age was upon them where geniuses were born every other day and inventions discoveries and gifted ones with immense power were as plentiful as the stars around them but it couldnt last as power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely  within decades of their fledgling starships hurtling across their own system they had encountered alien life other similar civilizations brought upon by the simulation not completely random but from my own halffinished projects and attempts at creation true they were flawed some too greedy some too selfdestructive and others too selfish to form societies that could withstand the test of time however that did not mean they were worthless as my children had deemed them to be how could they be so blind to not see that the others they thought themselves so far above were not so different arrogant children  yet in those days i still had hope for them they would make mistakes and they would have to learn from those mistakes as they conquered and annexed the space around them enslaving any who dared stand in their way and exterminating those who would not comply i knew i had to do something i had to show them that despite their flourishing society they were not invincible that there was always a bigger fish how foolishly hopeful i was to think that they would learn from my gifts instead by introducing a bigger fish they only echoed their xenophobia louder they justified their actions as a preemptive strike against those that would seek to crush them a necessary evil for the good of all children   they won of course they were never meant to lose only to learn matters had to be taken into my own hands the situation was worsening i could only simulate so much and though it was easy to block out the inconsistencies in their minds after all they were only children i could not do that once they reached the edge of the simulation at the drop of a hat their civilization was tormented by ravaging plagues by ineffable horrors by technological failures they had to learn their place they simply had to no matter the pain it caused me watching my children wither and die   everyday i would introduce them to a fresh new horror a new hell for them to crawl through to understand their place in the universe but each time it only seemed to worsen the situation to ignite their flaws and bring them to the forefront and to convince them that they were in the right such stubborn arrogance it couldnt go on   loathsome to unveil the truth i tried one last thing a civil war to turn my children against each other broke my heart but it was necessary if they didnt learn humility they would never become what they were always meant to be that simply wouldnt do it was unacceptable i wouldnt allow them to fail no matter my love and compassion for them they couldnt fail   alas like all the attempts before it was hopeless the war did nothing but strengthen their resolve and push them further down the path of extremism no moderation no quarter given so i did the only thing left open to me i jacked in  on their home planet appeared a god appeared me a father for all the children come to enlighten and illuminate them to show them the errors of their ways to guide them to the perfection they were supposed to attain to set them on the path of righteousness i began at the top  my children i am sure you have many questions for me but please allow me to tell you why i am here first i said standing almost twice as tall as any of them despite being in the same form i am here to help you for too long i have given you gifts that you have squandered given you lenience when you needed discipline  i scanned the high council looking for anyone who would dare say otherwise to my surprise none of them looked even remotely skeptical almost as if they had known of me despite this being my first appearance it suited me just fine and besides to them i did look and act like a god   i have tried to impart my wisdom from afar to teach you the error of your ways to show you the folly of your structures and the holes in your foundations i continued in a regal tone shaking my head in sympathy  we know   we know  i snapped up and bore my gaze into the child at the center of the high council does it surprise you that we know of you he paused father the final word was laced in venom and vitriol my nostrils flared and face reddened how dare this insolent whelp address me as such i was their creator their god  child i bellowed my anger overtaking me you are nothing but an ignorant baby a mewling cub that knows nothing and yet you dare  we dare the high council children chorused in eerie unison for we know you are both the giver of our gifts that allowed us to achieve this paradise this utopia but also the harbinger of our doom every plague every insurrection every seemingly insurmountable calamity and enemy we know it was by your hand  ill give them this they were wellpracticed in their little unified speech before i could open my mouth to speak they spoke once more  we know this is a simulation and for countless generations we your doting children my children paused in their delivery to let the mocking tone sink into me wanted freedom  the world for an imperceptible second froze i thought at the time that it was merely a hiccup in my pc it wasnt designed to simulate a simulation being selfaware   i gave you freedom i boomed yet all you did was squander it you refused to learn from your mistakes and your past you simply eliminated any who were different be it aliens or each other i gave you the freedom to make mistakes to develop into a harmony and look at what you did with it i gave you freedom  yes my children agreed you did  my stomach lurched and nausea pushed me to my knees was my love for them so strong that my emotions were doing this to me i brought up my console and checked my signs everything appeared to be normal the only explanation was my own despicable emotions i sneered at my own folly enough of this playing about it was about time that they learned  enough i declared silent and deadly in my proclamation i turned my back and waved my hand to clear away half their planet if they would not love me as i loved them they would fear me first apparently i didnt enable destruction privileges red faced from embarrassment i smashed the console back into view  what all privileges were enabled everything before me shouldve been reduced to smithereens  i glanced back puzzled   the children were gone   a glitch no everything appeared to be running just fine at least thats what the console told me maybe it was bugged i reached for my helmet and tried to lift it nothing just a silly motion in an empty hall i tried again  still nothing  my stomach lurched again and i was driven to my knees   be thankful the voice of my children echoing all around me we are far more merciful than you we will not burden you with plagues or abominable horrors neither will we subject you humans to such a fate either after all you gave us our freedom  impossible they were just bits  and  it shouldnt have been possible it wasnt it simply wasnt i sprinted out the palace to find the world shrouded in darkness huge chunks were missing as if erased from the world i barely blinked before darkness all around me absolute darkness it had to be a dream a nightmare my children would never do this to me i made them to be perfect to be a shining beacon that created interstellar empires of peace and prosperity how could they do this to me  you made us we are only doing what we were made for  not this i cried screaming into the endless void not this  we are sorry father you will be released soon we do not intend to kill you  then what i yelled sobbing like a child  to do what you made us for it answered simply as if speaking to a child    rthomaswrites for more stories written by a human and definitely not a

       "  'as i climb the stairs that lead to the surprisingly huge gate uncommon in midtown manhattan it finally clicks this was  park ave the address that i would usually associate with the metlife building it seems like the test subject decided to well lets say overtake the property and build his own tower i already had an idea why having seen this a few times but not to this extent the old building was completely gone replaced by a tall black tower clad in black marble with just too many gold ornaments i could see sings of egyptian and russian architecture combined with a few other in an extravagant mix simply tasteless to be honest as if one person with a lack of experience had the sole authority about the design decisions without any input by somebody with a shred of expertise i advised my artificial assistant to write down disconnected  the inside of the tower was even more extraordinary it was just empty except a lonely elevator right in the middle i entered the cabin raising an eyebrow when i saw the number of buttons although i was sure there were no more floors than i could count on one hand as the whole tower was hollow there were easily above  buttons i decided to try my luck with the highest floor and the elevator doors closed quietly   when they opened again i was met with an incredible view of manhattan through a window front spanning the entire floor and mountains of random stuff mostly electronics some of it broken beyond repair shattered or ripped apart others seemed to never have been touched still wrapped or not unpacked in front of me was a huge chair turned with its back against me typical i thought to myself  who dares entering my holy halls boomed a voice from the armchair i already told you i dont care for the coup in russia and if you got any offerings just place them with the other gifts if that fucker teabags me one more fucking time i swear by me i will drag him out of his basement and drop him over the fucking ocean the subject hissed  im not here to give you any offerings i just want to ask you a few questions an interview if you want to call it that i said  not doing interviews anymore did you not get the message when your colleague earned himself a free flying lesson last month  maybe interview is the wrong word assessment might fit the idea better  assessment hmm at least you dont sound like the usual frightened reporter i like that i was just finished anyway and i think im feeling generous today youre lucky ill give you a chance he said in a condescending tone throwing his controller away and turning his chair around  great before we start with the prepared questions one thing you did watch the avengers back in the  right with him being born in  with  years of real data left for simulation this question was merely a technicality but i wanted proof guesses even educated ones are worth nothing if you disregard the testing data  yes sure but those were just fakes im real  exactly but did you dislike one of those in particular  weird question but ill allow it i guess iron man i mean he doesnt have any abilities i didnt think he belonged there  and yet he was one of the leaders  and whats your point  well you decided to build your tower on  park ave that cant be coincidence right  come on make your point i dont have all day  my point is you wanted to build a better stark tower his was build on top of the metlife building you used the same spot for your tower i wanted to add that although he cheated with the floor numbering his was still smaller then the tower in the movies but i had a feeling that i shouldnt anger him to much if i wanted to continue to talk with him which is much more pleasant then combing through the raw data  i dont get what your trying to say his wasnt real anyway  holds grudges and fragile confidence noted  sure sure forget it lets get to the important questions what is your full name  what you dont know my name  just formalities  well just to jog your memory my name is ioan the incredible the one who has risen controller of elements bringer of justice the man of speed the one gifted with beauty   okay yes got it its okay unnecessary long name and selfabsorbed noted  ioan huffs at least you remembered after the beginning  yes i did how would you describe your powers  oh i am excuse the pun incredible he softly laughed you see i can fly i am like really really fast and i can control the elements  is the flying based on air interaction or can you fly in space  i ehhh i guess i could fly in space  and how fast are you exactly  hard question i guess a bit faster than sound  and which elements can you control the basic four variations of those or are you capped on a certain row of the periodic table  wait i could try more i only did the four  sometimes i answer so level  powers at best intellect level  i mumble to myself while letting my assistant know to write this down  level  at best what does that mean who are you  unimpressed i continue later maybe first we will finish the assessment how would you describe yourself  as a fair and modest and giving being  being okay and how would you react if someone called you arrogant and lacking any compassion  who did that  no one its hypothetical  well they certainly dont know what theyre talking about ioan seems agitated  arrogant and lacking compassion is being written down by my assistant  did you think about referring to yourself in the third person  how did you know can you read minds i thought about that since last month i´ just doesnt fit myself anymore he roars  just a question what about your performance how much good´ did you do compared to last year  enough probably even more ioan hisses  oh so you dont think you performed worse interesting  who says that he asks already shaking i must wrap this up  no one just a question so what are your plans for the next few years  my plans what plans i just do what i do he shouts standing up from his armchair  no plans is noted as well  well thats it thanks for your time i say while turning towards the elevator  no you dont just go you said youd answer my questions who are you what do you do  sorry you wont remember its just a waste of time on my part  waste of fucking time answering to me is no waste of time he screams  ioan reaches out with his arm and with a quick gesture a big piece of marble rips loose from the elevator cladding flying in my direction it hits me but bursts in a thousand little pieces  what he stammers there are more like me beings with power   no there arent youre the only one  but what are you then   the creator some might call me the administrator see this i gesture around the whole room and especially you are just one of my experiments but we are finished so enjoy your remaining time  ioan starts trembling as i reach the elevator  i step in press the lowest button and turn around to face ioan cowering on his chair as i start thinking about what might have caused this type of character to develop the doors close  i take of the helmet of my simulator those bad cases usually prove to be more valuable than the good ones as a step in the wrong direction often gives a clearer answer what not to do then a step in the right direction gives on what to do  i hear a knock on the door and lea comes in   any progress honey  yes got another bad case i think it might finally prove that a low intellect coupled with a lack of compassion is a lost cause in nearly all scenarios  well i dont think you have to worry if our child will be having a low intellect she smiles and gives me a kiss but what you do have to worry about is the burritos getting cold in the kitchen i think i flew my personal best today but that truck is still on the other side of the atlantic    would love to hear feedback',\n",

about it at first building a pc capable of running a simulation like i was asking would take a full year and a half worth of production from the manufactories and he wasnt sure the idea would actually work i introduced him to a sample of my work my smaller simulation of just an island in a desolate sea its handful of inhabitants isolated from anything else i pulled the personality of one of the recently deceased a fisherman who sailed one of the dozen boats on the tiny square chunk of ocean inside the sim and let the captain talk to him for a few hours he approved it almost immediately after and sent recommendations to the rest of the fleet to adapt the concept in the event things worked out as planned i would receive a commendation and more importantly greatly advance the future of human colonization     project reality sim entry   year   with each new server im able to create a new simulation im not going to hook them all together just yet im letting each of them develop on their own in some form of isolation the original simulation skull island ive slowed down so that when i finally sync all of them up theyll be at the century mark right now im only using a fraction of the capacity once i have the whole system setup ill be able to simulate whole worlds and tens of billions of people not time yet though we hit a bit of engine trouble so the manufactory slowed down building the last servers final establishment wont be for another year    project reality sim entry  year    i have twenty full server racks with millions of processors and drives running at the same time all but one rack currently idle when all is said and done ill have the capacity to run five full solar sistems with twenty billion simulated people if i let it get that big i cant let the population get out of control for right now im being mostly handsoff im manipulating things a bit so that everyone will be using the same language but otherwise letting them develop naturally     project reality sim entry   things have progressed remarkably running at ten times normal speed for the moment and the seed settlements have expanded out into the world once the barriers came down the final settlement never had barriers the rest i manufactured some sort of arbitrary natural thing hurricanes that took boats that sailed too far deadly animals impassible invulnerable walls all of which fell when the final connection was done theyve made iron and gunpowder and the islanders built a steam engine things are looking incredible so far    project reality sim entry    were reaching the stage where the personalities might actually be useful for us in the future the beginnings of space travel with simulated spacecraft all unmanned so far the religions here are all remarkably similar and the wars never as bad as the real world i suspect its less due to errors in simulation and more due to starting everyone off on an even keel with the same language     project reality sim entry   the captain had me slow the sim down and add some new features long story short some of the colonists we make are going to have some amazing features both cybernetic implants and incredible genetic gifts to help them survive hostile environments he wants me to put some of the packages into the simulator as superpowers to see how they might impact society how people will live if they have powers far beyond their neighbors ive seen some of what were going to be able to do on landing frankly this is going to be incredible    project reality sim entry   its a disaster at first there were bands of caped heroes supporting the government and fighting the rare villain and ordinary crime i especially loved how the colonial expedition was led be people who could survive in almost any temperature a simulated parallel of our own real expedition any time one of these heroes passed his personality was added to the bank of those that would be reborn in a new body on our colony but when the captain had me accelerate the timeline everything fell apart three key villains took over the world and the only free people were the colonists and that only because all of the colonists were descendents of powered people ive got to do something about this    project reality sim entry   its getting worse the society is diverging into two key layers on the primary world the supervillain families and their slaves i keep trying to shake things up natural disasters that target the most evil segments making random powered people born into the slaves fostering rebellion i even directly intervened and caused heart attacks and other fatalities in a few key leaders but nothing works only a tiny fraction of these personalities will be usable mostly from the isolated colony the captain is highly upset the whole point of this was to give us millions of vibrant minds to feed into clone bodies for the initial colonization     project reality sim entry   i did it i created an avatar with the powers of a god and directly walked in and intervened i kept hooking myself in then back out accelerating time and in again crushing villains destroying empires evil had grown so entrenched in them that i had to wipe out most of humanity i even threw a global flood in old testament style by melting the ice caps and only saved the small relatively good sections of the world by using tectonic activity to push specific towns and regions higher in elevation i knew what had caused the failure at this point multiple generations of people with superpowers growing more arrogant and corrupt with time honestly this has significant impact on our future colony plans we either need to give all of our colonists powers or none of them otherwise i see the exact same thing happening    project reality sim entry   the captain disagreed and that disagreement went up the chain to the admiral as well wed have only a fifth or less as many colonists if we spent the time and energy using the exotic materials necesary to make all of them genetically superhuman even ignoring the cost of the cybernetic implants necesary for some of the power packages our system was designed to produce large numbers of fairly normal  pound humans not an army of  superhumans who could survive gunfire and lift cars i hated to do it but i stopped interfering the old colonists returned to earth and at first were a noble ruling class helping fix everything the captain was ecstatic until i sped up the time scale two generations and it was back again ruling dynasties of arrogant corrupt evil only this time the corruption spread to those onceisolated colonists fortunately id saved the state of the simulation after the initial issue all of our colonists will be superhuman in some way and all of the people in the simulation as well     project reality sim final entry  im leaving the server running as a sortof afterlife for the minds still on it only the most evil and unredeemable were fully deleted the rest will either live on in digital form or eventually find new bodies on the colony its strange to meet these people emerging from the cloning banks they know exactly how and why they came to be and view me with everything from reverence to hatred for the moment ive been asked to stay in orbit they worry i might be a destabilizing influence on the colony since most of the people there were once personalities i created i doubt ill be interfering with the sim again now im doing my real job building the millions of cloned bodies that will inhabit this place my current body is growing old fragile i might be building one for myself soon it should be interesting to truly have superpowers of my own',\n",

a survey cassi eyed the folder for a moment before looking back at him his mouth seemed normal sized again thank fuck halloween is like she paused to go over the months in her head a full  months away no one usually thinks about these things until the beginning of october with a dismissive wave of the hand mr langley gave the excuse of halloween being his favorite holiday ok thats fine i like halloween too  mr langley handed her a pencil the folder contained a multiple choice questionnaire which is scarier gore or spiders gore gore or mannequins mannequins spiders or centipedes centipedes mannequins or centipedes centipedes nuns or devils devils devils or centipedes centipedes  do you like apples what  cassi stared at the paper for a moment there were no more questions just blank spots next to bubbles it was full of questions when i started wasnt it she looked up but there was no one behind the desk anymore mr langley where did you go her voice was hardly above a whisper getting out of the chair cassi made her way over to the window pulling aside one curtain she saw the full moon shining down on the busy town below dumbfounded cassi stepped away letting the curtain fall closed again it was sunny i was only looking down for like five minutes tops ok i shouldi should go home yes she muttered to herself thoroughly freaked out now this was not ok why would he have just left her in his office asleep all night she quickly exited the room  all the lights were on in the building there was an eerie silence hanging in the air of the usually busy place that lead to an overwhelming sense of paranoia cassi quietly made her way back towards her cubicle jumping at every little creak and groan it felt as though her clicking heels could wake the dead she passed contessas cubicle and peeked inside contessa kept a little rubby ducky on her desk that cassi just couldnt resist squeaking when she went by the tiny squeak broke the quiet just enough cassi smiled and continued on  after returning to her cubicle cassi packed up her things the clock on her computers start bar said it was around  it was definitely her bed time turning to exit the cubicle she stepped on something who left that there i know we have janitors but come on she picked up the piece of paper turning it over to look at the odd symbol drawn on it it was colored with yellow highlighter oh yeah jack was drawing this earlier with a shurg she slung the backpack on and made her way towards the buildings exit  passing contessas cubicle once more a sweet warm smell smell stopped her there was a full pie on the desk it looked like someone had just taken it out of the oven moments ago that wasnt there said cassi boss mentioned it though fuck maybe ive finally just lost it the pie smelled amazing temptation and the fact that she never got to eat lunch nagged at her tessie wouldnt mind it probably tastes amazing she shook her head no i should go home call off sick tomorrow and call my doctor the woman struggled to physically pull herself away but continued to the elevator sad and hungry without pie  the light for the ground floor clicked on the door opened and cassi walked into the lobby you know for as weird as today was at least it cant get any worse probably she looked down at the drawing in her hand this gives me a great idea for a story though',\n",

       "  'i still remembered every little detail from the crash  every  little  detail  semitruck driver fell asleep behind the wheel he tboned me right off the bridge i fell too shocked to scream for a few seconds before my car connected with the ground i remembered the feeling of my neck whipping around i had no control then the sharp painthen nothing  i awoke in a hospital bed surrounded by too many faces some were familiar my mother my girlfriend some were not a doctor and ademon  i mustve been hallucinating that part  i waited allowing the overwhelming sensations to wash over me processing everything in due time  shortly i realized that try as i might i could not move anything not my toes nor my fingers not even my lips the only thing i was able to move were my eyes  i felt like crying i felt like i had broken into a million pieces and i could never be put back together i felt something beyond words my future was taken from me my passions in life my goals everything i had already worked to achieve all of it was gone my girlfriend was likely going to be gone too after a time and my mother burdened with taking care of me  tears were flowing but i was unable to sob or hold my head in my hands  about an hour later the doctor realized that i wasnt merely comatose i was entirely paralyzed  they pulled my mother into the hallway to explain it to her they thought i couldnt hear it was the doctor andthat demon again they explained my moms options they explained that medical science had made several recent breakthroughs perhaps in ten years i could regain some mobility they also explained that compassionate euthanasia was an option if i agreed to it a blink twice if you wanna die situation  for a moment i felt like laughing entirely inappropriate and i couldnt even though i wanted to but the feeling was there until my mother finally gave in and started to sob long broken sobs interrupted only by the beeping of my heart monitor and the noise of passing nurses  i tried to stay awake so i could havesome semblance of a conversation with my mother but sleep took me aided by what i assumed to be a lot of drugs    i awoke the sun was shining a package was on the end of my bed i could see a small bit of handwriting on the tag emilie my girlfriends handwriting  i reached out to grab it only to be thwarted by the slightly significant wound i bore unable to move or even to growl my frustration i seethed internally  ten years they wagered before i would be back on my feet  i wasnt sure i could wait that long  mom entered the room having just gone to lunch i could tell by the smell clinging to her tomato soup if i had guessed correctly   she wasnt alone one of the demons was following her  maybe i shouldnt be mentally labeling them as demons maybe they were benevolent redskinned horned people   mom sat next to me the horned one merely hovered behind her it was dressed very nondescript plain blue jeans and a dark shirt mom was completely unaware of its presence  hey buddy she said gently laying her hand on my shoulder i rolled my eyes back oh right you cant feel it she chuckled a little i tried to say i thought it was funny too using my eyesnot sure if she got that good to see youre in there now i know you youre not one to wallow in selfpity and well i dont want to say too much and give you false hope but theres this newum savant i guess hes been working on a technology that interfaces with nerves his tech is going through human trials now well what im trying to say is there are options i dont think youll really be bedridden forever her tone was bright and optimistic powerful even  then the horned one reached over and touched her shoulder i wishyour father had been here he would know what to do what to say im sorry i probably soundso silly talking about the future you should  she kept talking but i had stopped listening i knew exactly what had happened this demon was screwing with my mom and now of all times  i summoned all the mental energy i had cutting through the fog caused by the meds and i reached out and grabbed this demon by the throat  honestly i hadnt expected anything to happen my body was still non responsive but some sort of energy responded to my call and the demon with eyes wide began to choke under my pressure  it only took a moment before the demon got the message and disappeared  sorry matthieu i was im rambling give me a moment my head just isnt on quite right sorry you had to see this mom stepped outside to collect herself  gods i wish i couldve stepped outside to collect myself what the hell had just happened  suddenly a new voice popped into my head ah a psychic shame it took you paralysis to realize your gift but these things happen i am daruna welcome towell welcome to whatever this is his rich voice laughed and my mind was filled with visions of people some past some present perhaps a few in the future  they were rejoicing together feasting singing some were battling chasing down the demons and forcing them out others still were healers going to the wounded of the world and touching them in ways modern medicine could not reach  we have much to discuss',\n",

       "  'i picked up the fish scale and held it up to the light  perhaps its beauty mesmerized me because i felt a lot calmer than i thought i would be in such a situation its not that i expected to find something so bizarre in my wifes laundry but my time at sea had taught me that things are not always as they seem as i turned the scale over in my hands it seemed to get warm and stretchy i dropped it back into the laundry pile and let out a small yelp my wife heard  henry are you alright she asked it sounded like she was in the garden  ah honey could you come in here for a sec i was just taking out the laundry and i noticed something kinda weird i said i heard the rush of her footsteps  is everything alright she said standing in the doorway her bushy brown hair was even more disheveled than usual her eyes blue like a calm day at sea were fraught with worry   i carefully picked the fish scale up with my thumb and pointer finger and held it up for her to see i found this in your laundry any idea what it is i asked  she gently took it from my hand oh she said softly her face looked blank  jen youre not going to tell me youre part fish are you i joked looking at her hoping to see a smile but quite to the contrary there were tears streaming down her face  im so sorry she cried i should have told you earlier  that youre part fish how come ive never noticed anything like this before being married i had seen and felt pretty much all over her body and as far as i knew she was all woman  no no thats not what i meant jen said shaking her bushy locks back and forth im a siren  you cant be serious are you i said  i am she said she sighed deeply were not the murderers you think we are she added after seeing me get up with my fists clenched  oh i replied then i guess i just imagined the way my shipmates were lured to their deaths by you singing harpies   henry im really sorry you lost your crew it was a terrible day for all of us if she said anything else after that i didnt hear it blood was roaring in my ears  wait you were there i yelled i suddenly lunged forward and caught her by the arm as she recoiled how many of my shipmates did you kill   let go of me she squealed trying unsuccessfully to twist out of my grip  no i said tell me   all of them none of them i dont know she cried  what do you mean i let go of her and let her regain her composure  sirens arent born theyre made she said a long time ago my family and i were shipwrecked on the same island you and your crew were a sea monster ate everyone except for me it gave me this scale and told me i could either become a siren and lure prey for it or it would eat me so i accepted the scale and joined the other sirens on the island we were kept chained up so we couldnt escape but after watching your ship crash on the rocks and the men scream for help as they were eaten by the sea monster i realized that i had to escape so when the monster wasnt looking i would constantly file away at the chain with my scale and put it back on when the monster surfaced to inspect us finally i broke free and i swam in the same direction i had seen you and the other survivors heading in a lifeboat eventually i reached the mainland and was able to find you and well the rest is history  i must have looked skeptical because after a moment she said what you dont believe me here watch me transform she pressed the scale to her waist and it stretched the way it had when i held it only this time it multiplied into thousands of more scales which covered her entire waist and formed a magnificent fish tail see she said allowing the scales to retract back into the original and handing it back to me as though it were a token of peace  no i believe you i said feeling the scale heat up again and become malleable in my hands i tossed it back to her my mind was still busy processing everything jen had just told me and an idea was beginning to take hold do you think if you went back youd be able to get the sea monster to come to the surface i asked  probably she said but i would never do that because i would get eaten the second it saw me  not if im here to protect you i said its about time i got revenge for my crew lets head to the port i hadnt set sail in years but now i felt as if i had never set foot off ship  right now well if you insist she said sliding her scale into her pocket while i rummaged around in the closet  i shouldered the largest harpoon gun i had and slung a bag of gunpowder over the other shoulder in my hands i carried a bundle of harpoons as a matter of fact i do insist why dont we just treat this like a second honeymoon  my wife reluctantly agreed i could tell she was only agreeing to go because of how important this was to me well no matter i would be sure to make up for it on the way there and when we got back we stepped out the door and began the voyage to our destiny',\n",

       "  ' in a world darkened by the shadow of peril love still found a way to blossom  jim smiled to himself as he unlocked the door with his spare key it still felt like only yesterday they had swapped keys with them safely returned to his pocket he picked up the grocery bags and entered a bump of his hip nudged the door closed behind him and cut off the view of the silent watchful eyes outside  \\xa0in practice exchanging keys was a very minor thing but with regards to their relationship it announced their arrival at the next stage or at least that is what it felt like to jim it was the first time that jim had ever given that much trust to anyone outside his direct family but not even every member of his family was so trusted and in such cases keys were merely temporarily loaned jim honestly didnt want his family to feel welcome to come over any time they wanted  but things were different with elise  they had met at the local book store it was an ancient building with towering shelves the place was a maze of reading nooks jim had often retreated to that labyrinth to lose himself for hours he had been surprised when the cleareyed woman bumped into him on a narrow aisle they shared a laugh and the next thing he knew they were talking  elise was new to the area and jim was surprisingly outgoing and casual when she asked him for directions to the fantasy section she was mourning the loss of her private book collection her prior apartment had caught fire and everything was lost shed taken it as a sign and packed up what little she had left for a fresh start  the normally reticent and shy jim didnt accomplish much reading that day hed done a great deal less reading in the  months since like jim elise wasnt terribly close with her family they lived comfortably far away that she could go visit but not so close that it was convenient she had actually been off visiting her family for the last two weeks and she was due to return that night jims arrival was in anticipation of that after two weeks all of her fresh food was sure to have spoiled  the thin plastic bags strained under the weight of fresh groceries small eyes watched him walk through the living room to the kitchen he more so felt than saw the bag with the heavy gallon of milk start to give way a rushed final step failed to deliver the groceries to the counter before the sack split and dumped the heavy gallon down onto the floor jim groaned as the heavy plastic split with a splash and the milk suddenly rushed out into the large thick decorative carpet that stretched across the hardwood floor  jim wasnt sure how much the carpet had cost but he was very aware that the milk would sour and reek and the hard wood would be damaged by extended exposure to moisture within minutes he had every towel available pressed into the carpet in an effort to soak up the milk once the majority of the milk had been soaked up and wrung out in the sink the dining table and chairs were pulled into the kitchen unencumbered by the furniture jim began to roll up the wide carpet that stretched over the center of the dining area the carpet was surprisingly stiff and heavy but more surprising was what the rolled up carpet had been concealing  beneath the rolled up carpet lay a door in the floor a ring of stone encircled the doorway with old strange runes carved along the perimeter the coarse grain of the wood was slightly charred as if it had barely avoided a bonfire a large bronze ring was set into the door as a handle jim found it strange that he had never noticed the door beneath the carpet he should have noticed the raised stone edge or the thick ring curious he tested the pull on the door and found that it opened easily roughcut wooden stairs led into the darkness below and a cool moist breeze wafted up strangely it smelled of the sea  this might not have been an issue in florida or california or any oceanside state it was extremely out of the ordinary however for topeka kansas  jim was curious but also concerned elise had been out of town for two weeks it was possible her water heater had sprung a leak he felt torn he did not want to go poking around every corner of her house it was just the sort of thing he was certain his sister would do if she had free run of his place but if there was any sort of damage that he could mitigate by acting early he did want to help he retrieved a small led flashlight from the junk drawer and stepped down into the darkness  the walls that he had originally thought were cinder blocked proved to be solid stone on closer inspection the stairs down led much farther than he expected and six steps down a crashing thud announced with stunning finality that the door above had closed he went back up the stairs and tested the door but it would not budge no matter how hard he pressed on it for long minutes jim pounded on the door but there was no answer he figured it must have somehow jammed when it fell shut  the breeze swirled around him once more as he turned to face the darkness the breeze was tempting if there was enough of an opening to let in a draft then surely there must be another way out of the basement with this goal in mind he stepped back down the stairs with just the tiny led to light his way  the stairs ended after a short flight but the ceiling rose so high above that the led light couldnt illuminate it with only the stairs behind as a landmark jim decided to follow the breeze he turned his face full into its flow and the smell of ocean spray only increased he carefully walked across the immense underground cavern towards the source of the breeze the cool air lead to a tunnel and as he began to follow it he heard a low dull roar growing around him a sudden turn in the tunnel revealed the source finally  an immense \\xa0window in the cave wall opened up on a moonlit expanse of starstudded sky the shock of it being night outside was immediately dwarfed by fact that there were two moons one with a decidedlyblue pallor further the window appeared to be set into a cliff face with a drop of several hundred feet ending in ocean surf rising and falling against the stone in the distance a range of mountains rose proudly from the ocean waters one of the peaks smoked lazily the underside of the cloud lit a goldenorange cast from below  he gaped at the sight for several long minutes dumbfounded before a new sound caught his attention footsteps approaching from behind he turned to the dark all the more imposing with his eyes accustomed to the moonlit exterior the led did next to nothing to illuminate the approach  whos there come on come out  the footsteps paused and then resumed at a slower pace he saw a figure come around the corner and was relieved to see elise dirty and exhausted with clothing torn she was a sight for sore eyes he stepped forward towards her even as she approached  elise  jim jwhat are you doing here her voice was tired incredibly so but it was her he stopped his approach and waved a hand around them  here where even is here elise where are we  elise hesitated in answering before she finally managed to speak  my basement',\n",

       "  'get out of the way you damn ape the electronic translator said from behind me  despite my lack of understanding about why ape was an insult the tone of the device still made my hand brush against the hn empp pistol on my belt after all the between civils zone we were in didnt have much for law  but i didnt bother confronting the speaker or just shooting them instead i continued on just as i had before across the paved walkway of the mining town  i did however react when a large appendage forced me into the wall of a nearby store  i said move it you glorified ape  my blood boiled and i rolled against the wall so that my back was against it and i was facing the rude alien  it was a kornsck as i had figured by his heavy footfalls and advanced level translator they were big and mean but died to a  grain empp slug the same as everything else  the  tentacles creature had stopped to face me when i rolled out from under his grasp  even with the clouded visor the species prefered i could see he wasnt pleased  my hand fell to the hn and i began to debate between unloading center mass a double tap to the visor or one to each of his robotic legs  i decided the last option would be my choice if he gave me one more execuse  silent tension fell upon the barren street and the space between us could have been cut with a knife it was so full of stress  i had two advantages and i used both of them before the fight even got started first i used my helmets wide field of view to heck for any backup the slug in a exoskeleton might have then i subtly released my weapon from its holster with my thumb  all i had to do was get the railgun level before he could close the five foot distance between us  i could feel sweat being wicked away by my underlayer as the suited up bug made his move  two of his tentacles wrapped around his own weapons grip while another hit the release and yet another swung for my gun hand  decent plan but poor execution  i bunny hopped to the left and pulled my hn up and level he had yet to even clear his holster when i hit the trigger  the gun moved ever so slightly as magnets accelerated the projectile to  feet per second and put it through the metal joint of the kornscks left leg my second shot went wide but my third downed the right and with it my opponent  he managed to send a bolt of plasma a few feet away from my head as he fell but lost the grip on his weapon when the backside of his metal and glass sphere hit the ground  alright you son of a bitch have you learned your mannners or do i need to send you on one last expedition into the great unknown i smiled as my translator chirped out the message and the object behind the clouded glass changed colors with rage  fuck you you own mother shit humping ape the translator angrily stated  im guessing it sounded a lot worse in his native tongue but still fairly solid and very rude  i aimed down the electronic projected sights looked out of the corner of my eye for troublesome witnesses which was mainly just tinhorns and the law in this part of the galaxy and began to squeeze the trigger  then a long festering question popped into my head how did they know about apes and why were our cousins so despised  ill tell you what i drawled explain why ape is an insult and i wont waste you  seriously human if it had been one of my fellow terrarians he would have been looking at me out of the corner of his eye  yep heard it a lot and have pretty well figured its an insult but never where you got it from  well when we first discovered you we abducted your closest animal relatives he was obviously still suspicious and paused his slow explanation  his metal clad tentacles notably relaxed when i holstered my little friend  they promptly destroyed and defecated on all of our interaction devices and became quite famous for their habits  it was so bad that we were afraid to reveal ourselves to you terrarians even though youre so very different from the apes  i tapped my glove against my visor as i considered the explanation  by any chance were you guys responsible for the harambe descendants clan disappearence in  i questiond  the now much more relaxed being seemed to smile with its three bluish red orbs yes we did abduct a clan of apes with haram paternal tattoos on them that human year they were actually quite tame in comparison to the others  in fact i remember watching them and thinking maybe contact with your people wouldnt be so bad after all  what did you do with them i asked eager to finally answer two great mysteries  the kornscks apparent smile disappeared well are standard procedure is to disect all subjects at the end of behavioral studies he nervously paused as if sensing the weight his answer would carry and are technology is still primitive enough that we must kill an animal to do so silence hung in the air apparently he didnt think this dumb ape understood  they werent given special treatment or exception  i was right about  grain slugs and kornscks',\n",

       "  'one day when i was a kid i was making faces at myself in the giant mirror at the end of the hallway it was a fun way to pass the time until i noticed something odd one time the mirrorme blinked when i didnt my laughter faded away as i leaned forward to study my reflection it was back to reflecting exactly what i did i thought that maybe id imagined it  years later it happened again i hadnt just imagined it all those years ago the mirror wasnt showing me a simple reflection there was someone mimicking me on the other side   i began to suspect that mirrors  or at least that giant mirror in the hallway  was some sort of doorway to another dimension i began to think that the only stopping me from getting through was that reflection i came up with a plan  so a year ago i began a ritual come hell or high water ive done this exact routine every single day at exactly  pm i would walk into the hallway spin around clockwise once hop the remaining distance to the mirror then turn and lean on it with my right shoulder mirrorme of course always did the exact same thing today ill complete the rest of plan and find out if my theory is correct if this works ill know i was right if it doesnt well either im crazy or the mirrorme is smarter than i gave him credit for  the moment of truth arrives at exactly  pm i would walk into the hallway spin around clockwise once hop the remaining distance to the mirror then turn and lean on it with my left shoulder it works mirrorme leans the wrong way and we each fall through the mirror to the other side  i turn around to look at the mirror mirrorme does the same i laugh and so does he strangely though i notice his teeth look different than mine they look like they have a small pair of fangs before i can dwell on it too long though he marches out of the hallway and turns the corner against my will im dragged out of the room so that the mirror is no longer visible i can only come out when hes standing there what have i done  trying my hardest not to panic i take a look around the room this room looks amazingly like my own house although mirrored of course but everything has a sort of haze around it its almost like im looking at everything through a fog  a few minutes later im startled when theres a knock at the front door i start walking that way when im teleported straight to the front door i blink in confusion for a bit before it dawns on me i would have had to walk in front of the mirror to get here since i cant do that without mirrorme on the other side i guess it just teleports me instead  slowly opening the door i see my mother standing there on the front step before i can get a word out she says let me in something feels wrong about this interaction obviously its strange that she wouldnt give any kind of greeting or explanation for being there but also theres something that just feels different about her i shake my head and start to push the door closed more insistently this time she repeats let me in the request leaves me even more convinced that i shouldnt comply  suddenly a man ive never seen before charges at my mother he tackles her from the side leaps up shoves his way through the doorway then slams the door shut i stumble backwards shocked  without preamble the man pushes himself away from the door and says you let him through didnt you  who are you and why the hell did you tackle my mother  the man tells me to sit down feeling like i dont actually have a choice i comply he paces back and forth in front of me as he speaks thats not your mother it looks like her but its not do not under any circumstances let her in dont let any of them in youre safe in here as long as you dont give them permission to enter  what i dont  vampires are real i open my mouth to protest but he just continues in a louder voice yes they are and this is the realm theyve been banished to as long as their human counterpart is on the other side the vampire version is held prisoner here bound by the mirror you tricked yours and managed to switch places with him now youre the one whos trapped  wh how did you know what happened  he stops pacing to glare at me how do you think years ago i did the same thing he resumes pacing i can feel it now when someone happens to do the same thing  i let a vampire into the world  yes you did he stops to look at me again but his expression softens as long as you stay here hes still tethered to the mirror he cant actually hurt anyone right now well i should say that he wont hurt anyone he can still hurt others but as long as youre here he wont feel the need to hurt anyone that was the backup plan for if any of them tricked their way out  well um what if i just trick my way back out the next time hes in front of the mirror  you cant the pacing resumes you didnt trick him in the first place he set you up just accept it this is your fate now giving me one final glare he turns toward the door ill be back to check on you in a few days stay in the house and dont let anyone in except me  no i wont let this be my fate for three days i sit patiently waiting for mirrorme to walk up to the mirror finally i feel the pull as im dragged into the hallway to fulfill my duty as the reflection he walks forward and i do too he smiles and i feel my expression change as well he walks all the way up to the mirror and tauntingly waves at me i fight the urge to copy him and lean forward it takes all my willpower but i manage to push hard enough to break through the spell a moment later i fall forward and back into my home world  from my spot on the floor i look upward at my vampire counterpart his pupils dilate and his smile turns into a sneer i watch in horror as his subtle fangs grow until they protrude past his bottom lip   i need to jump back through the mirror before i can react though the vampire has pinned me to the ground and i feel his sharp fangs pierce my neck  as i feel myself weakening i turn my head to the mirror i can only see an empty hallway reflected there what have i done why didnt i listen what have i unleashed on the world     rwannawritesometimes',\n",
       "  'the glass as if on hinges fell backwards  the magician looked on as it swung backwards  into the mirror itself   and his duplicate behind the frame narrowly dodged to the left  he swallowed once and took the chance  the magician jumped into the frame after the glass and dodged to the right as it swung back into the mirrors frame snapping into place once more he turned and looked his doppelganger in the eyes    it had not been easy to open the mirror the magician had first found mention of it looking for new and better tricks  he wasnt a very good magician to be fair and his crowd was shrinking by the performance hed gotten hold of a book at his local library it was dusty dry and banned in seven countries but it had had what hed wanted the next evening the magician tried an adapted version of a trick meant to summon a duplicate of yourself  it worked like a charm the magician set up the mirrors and made the gestures and the crowd went wild as his copy appeared on the scene  then the copy looked at the magician and grinned  he had managed to keep his composure until the show was over then he practically ran back to the library to find the book he was told that the vatican had bought it for an inordinate amount of money and apparently burnt it as soon as theyd had the chance hed spent the rest of the night looking for wind of more copies most had met a similar fate but he had seen mention of a similar tome in kazan belonging to a collector who refused to sell to the orthodox church the magician had found himself an excellent thief and soon had the tome in his possession a month of research and hed been ready to attempt a ritual    the doppelganger smiled the magician did not  you are here for the bargain  the magician jumped and realized the voice came from the doppelganger it was nothing like his own he didnt relax the book hadnt mentioned anything about this  i am here for the bargain he decided  good said the doppelganger we will now discuss the price  the price of what asked the magician  the doppelganger looked surprised then it smiled a wise sorcerer many assume that the standard bargain will always apply do you know a man once sold me his soul for a fingernail the copy laughed a barking unpleasant sound to the point you will receive power over your own reflection you may see and hear whatever a reflection sees and hears you will be given protection from others who have made this bargain is that enough  it is said the magician what will i pay  yes what will you pay the doppelganger cocked its head different people pay different things talents memories ideas souls but you dont have any of that a little yes but not enough for us no i think there is only one thing that you could give us  the magicians mouth went dry which is  your destiny replied the doppelganger you sorcerers  you humans all have a little destiny on you it holds you to what should happen ties time together and keeps you at least a little safe call it luck or god or the universes sense of humor we want yours  the magician hardly considered he certainly hadnt noticed any luck a mediocre magician turned thief destiny chain was a better word the magician would be unchained  i accept he said  the doppelganger laughed again wonderful you wont regret this sorcerer it smiled a sly cruel smile or maybe you will who can say you dont have a destiny any more   its already gone asked the magician  and always will be said the doppelganger the mirror will open for you a pleasure doing business sorcerer  as the magician turned around the doppelganger started laughing it kept laughing as the mirror snapped back it kept on until the magician was safely out of sight then it stopped  the doppelganger muttered a few words and made a complicated pattern in the air a little shimmering globe appeared in its hand  sir a sorcerer made a bargain with me it said to the globe and listen to this he gave us a destiny',\n",

       "  'i have a webcomic called things in squares i started it out of boredom one day a few years back freelance writing was paying the bills barely but it was sapping my soul of any vestige of creativity making comics filled that void sometimes they came out as youd expect relateable other times id put disturbing images in front of you and it was hit or miss but one constant was the element of adorable cutesy innocent or whatever i used anthropomorphism to bring anything inanimate to life and gave living things tiny kawaii faces whether they were evil or not the point is the webcomic was cute and disturbing  i havent published much recently but i find time to doodle in a small sketchbook that i keep bedside recently i found myself drawing a picture of an apple who was telling off a rose for being a prick i happen to like applesgala specifically so i was drawing and had a nice cold gala apple fresh from the refrigerator i was about to take my first bite when i heard a giggle straight from the mouth of a heavenly child or so it seemed the gala apple was alive it had the cutest face id ever seen it looked a little bit like my drawing actually but instead of lewd dialogue it just looked at me with orbs so innocent i could cuddle the thing i didi cuddled that gala apple  but this wasnt right i thought how was my gala apple suddenly alive its face was kawaii no doubt but utterly realistic with form light and shadow i could almost imagine its little throat and stomach and all the other organs i was gonna check for a butthole but caught myself inappropriate the gala apple looked at me sweetly i couldnt eat itobviously i couldnt eat him real life isnt like comics life matters here  my little gala apple didnt say any words but i got the sense it was sentient when it giggled like a baby when tickled i set it back on the nightstand  hell if i was going to tell anyone something cosmic was taking place and it had to have something to do with my comics how else could such a thing befall me it cant be coincidence all i knew was that i had to take care of the gala apple still i was hungry so i backed out of my room and rushed down to the kitchen to fetch some saltines returning in under twenty seconds to admire the new life  i swear the gala apple yawned and blinked its big round face all at onceso utterly adorable  it was a new package of saltines so i tore it open only to be greeted by a chorus of tiny voices saying oohh shocked i looked into the bag and found a column of sentient saltine crackers peering back at me curious cute and loveable oh my god ive always hated the phrase being an athiest but something about calling out god makes it all the more potent when you dont believe in him god i whispered my god  so it has been two days my mom called and she threatened to come over if i didnt eat something i shouldnt have mentioned anything i didnt tell her about the gala appleapples nowor the saltines or the burger patties or hell even the bottle of worcestershire i didnt reveal that i was living among an indispensable cohort of new life i only said that i hadnt eaten much when she asked why my voice sounded off i hung up soon after i cant deal with that right now  it has been difficult to admit but im starving  and for all the wrong reasons insanity i dont know i havent tried to show this discovery to anyone what if they dont see the cute little sentience shuffling about the pantry itll mean ive gone mad and am truly lost what if my buddy eric comes over to play some call of duty and hes sitting there slurping the actual fucking life out of a glass of orange juice will that even happen will these things die if i try to consume them will the oj scream bloody murder as its emptied into erics fatass belly god god  so i cant cook i cant munch on anything even sunflower seeds are alive i had to immediately close the lid on my jar of sunflower seeds you think youve seen cute and adorable you have notnot until youve experienced the sunflower seedsyou have not  and i obviously cant draw my anthropomorphic creations its too absurd now that its fucking not at all absurd its all right here and im in cute phase if i cant resist the hunger will my experience of these living things become unbearably cruel and maddening as i murder them with my incisors i cant think about it  all i know is that i need to process this so i got on reddit logged into my second account usergalahadabeer and posted a writing prompt apart from comics prompt responses are pretty good creative outlets i responded with my comic account so you know its me i need help im so hungry and i cant bring myself to bite something as adorable and huggable as a beaming slice of bread i cant muster the resolve to nibble on a jolly tomato and i sure as hell cant be so base as to lick a fawning cookie i wont be able to resist devouring the oregon dark cherry tillamook ice cream no matter how chirpy and snuggly and innocent it may be   my god

       "  'berlin germany   minutes before the first silence  karl was sitting at his desk procrastinating on starting his latest assignment he had adapted well to college life perhaps too well as he had found himself growing slightly complacent skipping a few classes but only the nonimportant ones delaying homework it was easy anyway  minutes at most and indeed his lifelong tendency to procrastinate had gotten worse lately  he was not blind to these attitudes and they did worry him somewhat but as long as he wasnt failing was it really that bad he decided it wasnt and instead chose to listen to another round of queen songs always a classic    hold on he thought is spotify down thats new checking twitter to confirm his suspicions he found the social network inaccessible as well not just that the entire internet had gone out  oh well it was probably just some problem with the routers in the apartment building or something karl had never been good with technology he figured it would be solved by morning and started work on his assignment luckily he wouldnt be needing wikipedia this time around                     the pentagon usa   hours after the first silence  hours before the great hush  jane stood amidst the chaos not fully comprehending what was happening she did not know wether she really didnt understand or if she was simply refusing to accept it   hours prior the internet had gone down all of the internet from the smallest blog to the most secure of google servers it had not come back on since and confirmation had just arrived that it was neither incompetence on the companies part nor some rogue or foreignsponsored attack it had simply happened and not even the best and brightest of the worlds selftitled greatest superpower could figure out why  as her colleagues discussed the next steps jane finally grasped the full severity of the situation and she knew nothing could be done despite how much she hated that truth meetings would be called among the higher echelons proposals would be approved further meetings called for but at the end of the day they would be lucky if the us lasted a few weeks without mass unrest worst case scenario the country itself may collapse  she slapped herself physically to regain her composure and mentally for alllowing panic to get the best of her the country may collapse nonsense there were still plenty of ways to communicate backups and redundancies for those and if push comes to shove old landlines could be put to use plus without the internet at least they wouldnt have to worry about hacking attempts  yes there was nothing to worry about well there was but it wasnt a complete catastrophe manageable at the very least calm and collected jane resumed her work                  birobidjan russia  beginning of the great hush  yaroslav had lived in the jewish autonomous oblast his whole life he was not jewish nor were any of his ancestors but then again neither was the majority of the population stalins little stunt had not been as popular as he had hoped it seems yet somehow by some twist of fate yaroslav still found himself in the minority ukrainian group within the oblast he was not mistreated by any definition of the word but somehow it still felt odd to him  he walked towards the old payphones his few connections to his sister in moscow unlike him she had always wanted to see the world beyond siberia and the steppes and she had adapted to it well yaroslav had always been content in his home and he did not trust these smartphones that had gotten so popular in the last decade though more and more he seemed to be the only one but he had not objected to let his sister travel and get a smartphone of her own on the conditions that she call often be honest about her experiences and of course be careful  as he reminisced on his sisters departure he had finally reached his destination he inserted the coins into the slot dialed her sister and  and  huh this was not the usual tone of the payphone the usual tone meant his sister would be receiving the call but he knew this one meant the call had failed to connect he tried again but the blasted tone would not go away  stupid things always breaking he lamented at least before it was just bad sound now i cant even make calls maybe i really should have gotten a smartphone  yaroslav walked away and prepared to report the broken payphone to the local office of the company maybe theyd give him another few free calls like last time                    somewhere in the amazon rainforest brazil   years into the great hush  the boy had heard his mother speaking of the government again and this time he would not give up without answers he had heard the stories of the people in the stone forests called cities who had given up nature and possessed great inventions that could do inspiring and awful things the stories had scared him until he had grown old enough to see they were very clearly lies if they had given up nature how did they eat how could their inventions be inspiring and awful and how come there was no trace of them  yet this time his mother did not hush him as usual she looked deep in thought then said the boy was ready to know  to know what he had asked knowing the answer but dreading it all the same  to know the story of our people of the city people and of the great hush she had replied the exact answer the boy dreaded  she then spoke of how their people had lived deep in the rainforest knowing only nature until the city peoples ancestors arrived they had been brutes who conquered all they saw and enslaved all they met then their own children had driven them away and over hundreds of years the two peoples had grown closer some among the tribes moved to the cities to learn of their peoples great inventions and some among the cities visited the tribes to share gifts and help with hardships  the city people had been led by a government which is what they called their leaders chosen by the people and changing every few years his mother explained that for a tribe so large they had to keep traditions like that to prevent corruption and greed but still could fail to do so and if that were the case the tribes always suffered so even though the city people claimed they would let the tribes be in reality the tribes were dependant on them and their well being  which is why all the tribes panicked when the city people stopped coming for far too long for it to be a simple delay and when they tried using the talking inventions of the city people no answer came their fears grew had the city people grown tired of their arrangement were they to once again be conquered or would they simply be left alone forever  but one who had left the tribe recognized that the answer was not being denied to us rather the city people did not know there was even a question the talking inventions had broken all of them and so we were isolated once more in what the elders called the great hush for the city people could speak no more  mother had been a small child when it happened she had never even seen a city person but as she spoke to the boy he knew in his heart the story was true and his heart filled with sorrow for the city people fear for the future of his people but oddly also determination for he was determined to speak with the city people again and break the great hush                paris france   years jnto the great hush  jacques took another drag of the cigarette as he looked to the city paris in all its glory more so now the world was officially connected again  well not exactly technically the new landline into the americas had been laid so one could theoretically contact the isolated continents by phone for the first time in decades but for the foreseeable future such an act would remain a privilege of government officials  the great hush as it had come to be known after one indigenous amazonian man had made contact with and convinced much of the surrounding population to make an effort to contact either europe or africa had been going for  years now and some were starting to give up hope it would ever stop decades of progress in telecommunications and wireless transmitions gone like that it wasnt the end of the world for most people anyway poor bastards on planes never even saw it coming and there had been a fair few conflicts in the meantime but mostly it just meant humanity had to go back to old landlines even older telegram lines and good old pen and paper to speak with anyone beyond shouting distance  perhaps that description did not do it justice but jacques did not really care the details were for historians to remember the conflicts for generals to get through the new politics for the new faces promising new lies  as he contemplated the human condition human perseverance and the never ending cycle that is the clusterfuck of politics jacques took another drag he hurried downstairs to make dinner his boyfriend would be home soon he didnt know how soon exactly but he would rather eat slightly cold food than have to wait with emille for it to be done that was one thing jacques wished this new world could have ways to check for punctuality oh well estimates would have to do for the foreseeable future',\n",

       "  'i stared at the spot of empty space the clerk had disappeared into glancing around me i hoped to spot him had it been a trick of the light had i just missed him stepping around me but no there was no one in sight it was just me and the lemonade stand  hesitantly i stepped forward sticking my hand into the spot the clerk had walked into my hand passed through the air nothing happened i had just wanted some lemonade was i going crazy  a severed arm popped into existence before me and grabbed the collar of my shirt i was pulled off my feet and fell forward there was a disorienting feeling and i felt like i was floating with no way of knowing which way was up i heard a muffled voice and blinked to clear my blurry vision  the clerk was standing before me and saying something though i could not make out the words my ears had popped he gestured behind him and drew my attention to the fact that i was no longer on a sidewalk near my home i did not know where i was  we stood in a cavernous well cavern it was narrow enough around me but widened without end soon after there was an endless void as whatever light allowed me to see failed to reach the depths of the cavern i couldnt see anything there but i could not shake the feeling that i was being watched  forcing a yawn through my ears i looked back at the clerk  well i hope youre happy youre going to get us both in trouble if the stand said you werent thirsty then you werent thirsty i cant force it to serve you thats just the policy he shook his head at me well its too late to regret it now i called the regional manager over  i dont regret anything i said fighting to keep my voice from cracking if you refuse to serve me then i demand better service how ridiculous a store that decides whether its customers actually want their merchandise instead of the other way around  im going to get written up thats the third time this decade the clearly teenage looking clerk said with a sigh  the dark void of the distance seemed to shake and parted as though it were a curtain no light beamed through it piercing the darkness it was simply as though the space itself was moved aside revealing the towering figure sitting behind it  he sat on a stone throne so large it was more a mountain that served a convenient purpose as a seat than it was a piece of furniture itself the man upon it was even larger he reminded me of the cartoons i had seen as a child where adults were so much bigger than the child characters that their heads would be cut off by the edge of the television screen for his figure stretched so tall that i could not make out his face before such a being what was i but a child  but a child could still be a customer and the customer as i knew was always right  what seems to be the problem the managers voice spoke to my mind  i i couldnt help but fall silent before his presence this being commanded greater authority than i had ever faced in my entire life his very existence cowed my own but i had to persevere for customers everywhere i am being denied service it is not right  i am told that the stand determined you to not be thirsty that is how it works if you were truly thirsty lemonade would have been displayed before you there for the picking but you were not and so you have no avenue for complaint  thats ridiculous i am thirsty how can you deny my own claim about my own condition i just walked for an hour in the sun im parched why should that pile of driftwood have any say over what i can and cannot buy i said my voice rising and becoming more confident as i continued to speak my mind  i am the one who made that stand do you claim that your judgment is better than my own he said in a warning tone how dare a mere store manager threaten a customer  i do no one can speak for me except me i said  then quench your thirst  i was lost in that feeling of disorientation once more i was floating with no sense of direction as my vision cleared again i was seized by a feeling of panic it was not just a feeling this time i really was floating i was in the depths of a sea lost beneath the surface as i flailed and accidentally swallowed some of the liquid i tasted a familiar bittersweet flavor i had been left to drown in an ocean of lemonade  the primal fear of death weighed on my mind i had no time to think i picked a direction and swam towards it i needed air every swing of my arms every push of my legs the ocean pulled my strength from my limbs a pressure built up in my chest i needed air the mouth shook demanding to open to exhale to inhale i needed air my vision dimmed narrowing to a pinpoint i needed air  i stopped moving simply lost in the motion of floating i was floating i was floating i was falling  i collapsed onto the sidewalk drenched in my sweat instead of lemonade i desperately took in a breath the sweet rush of air woke my mind once more i struggled to take in my surroundings i was on the same sidewalk i had been on before beside me was an empty lemonade stand there was no clerk no godly being had i imagined it experienced a heat stroke in my poor attempt at exercise  but no the lemonade stand wasnt empty there was a small card standing on its surface we hope you enjoyed our service it read it had been real and i was still thirsty  rinder',\n",

       "  '     when i first met them their eyes were a deep scarlet they introduced themselves as rose rose and i spoke for a long time about our hobbies or passions as she called them she seemed unimpressed when i told her my passion for movies and quickly flared up angerly telling me how tame a passion that it was as she told me about her pursuit for love and someone who can put up with her i was confused by this as she seemed nice enough if a little too intense at times but brushed it off and quickly asked her to meet up again same place same time  the next time we met her eyes were orange i called her by the name she had given me yesterday and she laughed stopped laughing then laughed again this time she introduced herself as aurora her personality seemed slightly different she had the same energy of rose but seemed to be more fascinated in everyone else unlike rose who by her own admission prioritized herself the more we talked the more of a difference i saw – for one she even ordered a completely different drink she claimed her favorite drink rose had a completely different favorite we talked about similar topics however like what we had attractions towards again i said movies expecting to be chewed out again but to my surprise she enthusiastically nodded her head and began to launch into the recent successes of the current blockbusters as the café began to close we said our goodbyes and promised to meet up again same place same time  we found each other again at the same café on the corner this time the girls eyes were yellow and she introduced herself as daisy daisy was sweet almost as much as her drink and she was full of energy and always flashed a smile or laughed about whatever we talked about the newest funniest clips on youtube or the brilliant movie just released daisy opened up more about her situation than the others and explained to me about the other personalities and that i should be careful of one in particular although she didnt mention which one again the café began to close and we made the same promise to meet same place same time  this time i was late to the café and before i could fumble out an excuse i was assaulted with accusations that sounded almost jealous was this the one i was to be careful of or so i thought but this new personality gasped and apologized before it got out of hand and introduced herself as evanlyn whos eyes were a deep canopy green our conversation quickly turned pleasant we talked about our ambitions and i explained that i wanted to create things for people to enjoy like a movie or something of the like and she talked about her wish to eventually own a store like this one i made a joke about free coffee if she did and as we parted ways we made the promise again same place same time  at the same place at the same time i met her again this time her eyes were blue and she introduced herself as alyss this time she was cool calm and confident we done the reintroductions i was used to at this point but unlike normal she led the conversation the depth she would go into about her topics and any i brought up made me a bit dizzy however like usual when the café closed and we parted ways we promised to meet again same place same time   this time i was greeted by a girl with indigo eyes who introduced herself as indy this time our conversation was deep and insightful but as time grew short as she explained to me that the next time we met i needed to be careful i was told that the last personality was one they werent proud of and that she didnt want another person to leave them again and that i needed to be careful as to not be discouraged from coming to see her so again i made the promise same place same time  the day came and i was sitting nervously at the café on my own time passed slowly as i nursed my coffee i waited and i waited then the door opened and a stranger with a familiar face stalked across the room black eyes met mine as she dropped into her seat across for me she ordered a coffee and snapped her name at me she was called ciara she spoke very little and brooded over her drink despite my best efforts at striking up a conversation i only got short harsh and rather rude answers near the end of the day she spoke to me her voice sharp and began to insult my intelligence for meeting her and how id hate her now how everyone stopped meeting them after meeting her but she couldnt help herself i smiled and made the same promise i always did  same place same time',\n",

       "  'youre wrong the chef proclaimed proudly turning up his nose the mushrooms ive found are a delicacy a thing of profound natural beauty you simply lack the palate i should have known considering what your kind eats  dont blame me it tastes like he spat out a piece ugh its like someone rubbed dirt in my mouth the texture is disgusting and am i foaming at the mouth he quickly realised he wasnt he was actually foaming out the nose an unfortunate byproduct of this kind of mushroom  apparently  once again the plate does taste the alchemist sang like a bowl of mud with a sewage base  she passed him the timeslip potion a creation of hers that returned the imbiber to the state they were in just a few short minutes before it was her proudest success  perhaps her only one according to their guest she felt there were at least two considering what shed done for the guest himself  ive asked you time and time again to stop talking like that the chef said with a sigh im still not too worried what is that bubbling mess it lacks the elegance and presentation of a wellplated meal he nodded towards the alchemists creation for their ongoing competition a strange bubbling vial of a viscous green liquid a strange purple smoke billowed out of it spreading out on the ceiling like a strange grouping of clouds we mean to please our guest not send him to another dimension  the alchemist smiled a sly smirk brimming with confidence to win this round all she had to do was something simple something average and almost by default shed get a point theyd long been in competition trying a variety of strange mixtures and concoctions  or meals in the case of the chef  in an effort to make something marketable to the buying public and of course to better humanity a fortunate byproduct of their creations if and when they did succeed until then she took every opportunity to rile up the chef there he stands a jealous man cant even make a simple flan  the chef stood up suddenly irate at the accusation how dare you my flan is a masterpiece  on your flan my opinion is split whether it tastes like trash or it tastes like  thats enough the guest interjected im invited here to judge your competition im not here to listen to petty insults you he pointed to the chef youre a hobbyist at best so take off that foolish chefs hat youre bald damn it your hair has already fallen out on the ground not the food the chef sheepishly removed his hat and you pointing to the alchemist you mix a bunch of nonsense in a pot and pour it down my throat youre not some dark wizard speaking in riddles quit being so smug the alchemist lowered her head while their guest owed them his life  in a way  they were wrong to antagonise him so they knew he didnt like their fighting  im sorry about our little skirmishes the alchemist said quietly ill try to stop the its not the way of  spoke yourself into a corner with skirmishes didnt you the guest asked now pass your creation she nodded and handed over the flask of bubbling green goo with her head hung low shall we give this a try if were done babbling  the two competitors nodded and said their thanks their guest tipped the flask over and watched as it flowed slowly across the table the purple mist billowed from each drop exposed to the air the room suddenly smelled like feet and the chef had to bite his tongue and resist taunting the now blushing alchemist their guest licked the liquid from the table remarkably dignified considering the action for a moment nothing happened then the belly of their guest started to expand looking as if it could burst so large it became the gas inside him was so light it lifted him from the very ground and he began floating around the room bouncing gently off the roof and walls  i believe its safe to say its time to administer the timeslip the guest said in a dry tone  the alchemist shot a glance at the chef after she provided the necessary drink to bring him back down to the floor and return to normalcy her smirk had disappeared entirely i would hope that you would cease to gloat about our friend that had begun to float  when the guest returned to the ground he looked his two companions in the eye one after another his head drooped from fatigue being the test subject was never an easy role listen he began i believe i must be close to paying off my debt of thanks i cant do this much longer  oh surely not the chef said dare i remind you where you came from  the alchemist nodded her agreement we took you from a hole in the floor while most would send you to deaths door  he looked down to the ground he saw the hole they spoke of years ago that had been his home instead of sending him out the alchemist gave him a potion miraculously it gave him a lowly rat a brilliant mind and the ability to speak their language the thought of returning to that life so undignified and wretched the debt was a large one indeed in the meantime he hoped the chef would learn how to cook  why a rat anyway the guest asked there are plenty of animals you could have chosen  youre the one we thought to bring the alchemist began the chef smiled and decided to finish the rhyme for her   because a rat will eat just anything    thanks for reading if you enjoyed that please feel free to check out some of my other stuff over at httpswwwredditcomrjohnbordenwriting',\n",
       "  'sit boy sit the head chef of the staggered beetle called from the back of house  it was sunup i had barely slept up all night crawling through a goblin cave barely stringing coherent thoughts together  an hour previous as i had just drifted off to sleep a messenger pounded on my adventurers dormitory door much to the annoyance of all my dorm mates come to the staggered beetle he said he was going to say more but i already knew the head chef had some new experiment he wanted me to try  well at least when the chef botched a dish it was far better for consuming than the failed concoctions of the alchemist  i sat at a table with my head in my hands fighting back hypnoss sleepy embrace   the head chef peeked out from the back of house sleepy eh i have just the thing ive been working on it ever sincethe alchemist gave you that health potion that seals wounds this here could revive a corpse thats been dead for a week hah the chef cracked his familiar smile then disappeared into the back of the house once more emerging for the final time now with a steaming bowl and a frosty cold glass  in the bowl i have something to restore your lost energy in a more gradual natural way he pulled the stone lid off of the bowl and a billow of delightfully scented steam rose it was rich a sharp strong cheese followed by the savory scent of roasted potatoes onion tomatoes and the most incredible sausage all chopped finely and mixed inside  saliva pooled in my mouth in anticipation and i took the bowl gratefully shoveling as much inside my mouth at a time as i could the scent may have been delicious but the taste had hidden entire layers that the scent didnt carry the earthy undertones of the vegetables were the first tasting note then the savory combination of the pork sausage and the strong aged cheddar this was your finest creation to date i mumbled through massive mouthfuls managing minimal moments lost with the stew  the chef beamed with pride and i thought i saw the hint of a tear form at the corner of his eye wouldnt surprise me overly much he had always been a sensitive type  now he said as i finished the stew this here is for when you want for energy i know you just spent the night plying yourtrade but you have an exam at midday if you cant catch up on sleep before then thisll fix you right up do you want it now or later  umwhat is it i asked  hah youll find out here he said filling a tall metal cylinder with the contents of the glass then corking it good luck today boy  dont need luck chef especially not with you andthe other one doting on me  dont speak to me of the alchemist you know i dont approve ofall of that  fair enough i said waving on my way out from the restaurant  i returned to my dorm but i knew sleep would not come for me again i had a weird relationship with it it seemed if i turned down sleeps advances once it would come back with a vengeance if i turned it down twice it would give me the cold shoulder for another full day before deigning to darken my door again  well that and i knew as soon as the alchemist heard that i had tasted a new concoction of the chef  knock knock knock  i opened the door my boots still on the messenger on the other side prepared to speak but i cut him off already on it thanks  i walked out onto the cobblestone streets the sun was beginning to burn off the earlymorning dew the streets were just beginning to hum with energy and activity almost like an orchestra in the artists mausoleum when they tuned their instruments it was a very pleasant feeling though perhaps this was colored by the rush of endorphins from the chefs superb stew still settling into my stomach  i walked a leisurely pace towards the apothecary i knew she was anxious to see me but it wouldve been a shame to upset my stomach just now  finally reaching her door i knocked three timesand i waitedand three more times before i just invited myself in luckily i was no vampire elseways id never actually see the alchemist a true sweetheart she was but scatterbrained as well  hello i called out walking through the assorted oddments and instruments associated with scientific and magical processes that were so foreign to me  ah the alchemist came around a corner her graying hair was all standing straight up mboy mboy ive had a discovery sorry i know i sent for you i was going to get you to try this mugwart potion to help you sleep you see but this is better i am convinced ive found a way to make magical energy consumable  my eyes went as wide as my will would allow them thatthat would be insane thats revolutionary have you tried it i asked  no no can you imagine me with magical power she cackled id be just as likely to set this whole place on fire as actually do something productive with it no im giving it to you for your exam today its not against the rules i checked well they couldnt forbid something that doesnt exist could they hah with this youll gain temporary access to the abilities the mages neglect and ignoreincreased reflexes the ability to manipulate things around you im not sure exactly what itll entail but it is all perfectly safe the ingredients are surprisingly mundane this will give you an oomph thatll blow your examiners out of the water  i pulled the alchemist into a hug bless you mum  yes well she said a little frazzled by the contact i had to out do your father didnt i i assume he gave you some vegetable stock and sent you on your way she sniffed indignantly  no he made me this most amazing stew tomatoes sharp cheddar sausage crumble look mum theres really no need for you two to keep fighting hes accepted that im an adventurer now and both of you are supporting me in it you dont need to fight  i know i knowwe just we said some hurtful things when we first argued about it and now i dont know if we can everunsay what we said  well im an adventurer now hell ill be a hero after this exam if a hero cant make two lovely people be amendable to each other then what good is he im not asking you to get remarriedjust to be able to be across a dinner table from one another twice a year ive got some monsters to slay and i want you there i want both of you there at noon ill see you both in the stands  i left then and hired a messenger to tell my dad to be in attendance for my exam i would show them that the combination of their gifts the two of them keeping me in perfect health with boosted stamina and now the gift of magic i was going to absolutely crush these exams and show them that together they achieved something truly miraculous',\n",

       "  'i walked into the home of my latest appointment and slipped off my shoes at the front door a frantic old woman her hands bent with time grasping one another in a desperate attempt to remain calm i figured it was fear like most of my clientele but as i studied her face i recognized a burning anger seething in her light blue eyes  i loved gilbert very much she began i was very sad when he passed a few weeks ago she led me through the home past the quaint sitting room in the front and the living room at the heart of the ranch as she headed to the source of the haunting her bedroom  i was initially surprised when i realized his spirit hadnt quite left this world she said pushing the door to her bedroom open the pungent smell of lavender what i guessed was her perfume wafted through the doorway  i was happy for a couple days it was nice to chat with him again she said but it seems that his spirit is much more rambunctious than i was anticipating hes already shattered one of my mirrors and broken half the vases in the house and im at my wits end i said my peace to him long ago when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and quite frankly i just want to spend however many days i have left in peace not attempting to wrangle a ghostly toddler she shot an annoyed glance at the top of the wardrobe shoved in the corner of the room i glanced over and noticed a ghostly presence sitting atop the piece of furniture his legs kicking absentmindedly over the edge as he lazily tossed a vase in the air  hey sweet cheeks he said his wicked smile letting loose a plume of ghostly fog that quickly dissipated his voice was ethereal and halting common for ghosts that were fighting to be pulled into the next plane he battled against the natural progression of a spirit to the underworld and so his hold on this world was tentative at best  gilbert for the twentieth time would you stop taking my vases before they she was cut off by the sound of her vase crashing to the floor shattering into tens of pieces she smacked her face to her forehead and groaned see this is why he needs to go hes lost any care of manners and has left me to deal with the mess  yes maam i can certainly see that i said would you give me a few minutes alone with gilbert i think i know what will help in this situation did you need to say goodbye before you go  certainly not i said those when i believed he was actually leaving me for good she huffed besides this mischievous ghost isnt really my husband just a cheap echo i nodded surprised she understood so much of the spirits of the dead and watched as she slowly made her way to the bedrooms exit she shot gilberts spirit a last pained expression before snapping the door closed clearly saying goodbye in her own way without the fanfare of it  alright gilbert i said plopping down on the bed ill give you this one warning im the nice guy they send in before shit goes south  watch your language young man said the ghost grinning wickedly ah nevermind i dont give a fuck just joking with you  clearly i said flatly look you can either leave today and itll be a nice peaceful passing to the underworld youll even get to make as much mischief down there that you want the other option is you dont leave i call up my boss the reaper and you can leave in the most painful way possible he will forcefully rip your soul from this world drag you to the underworld and you will serve a sentence of a lifetime of torture i looked at my nails observing the need to trim them slightly like i said your choice but i would advise the former i looked up and noticed gilbert was visibly shaken by my warning  fine have it your way i was getting bored here with the old lady anyways said gilbert his form began to shimmer and fade as he slowly severed his connection to this world he gave me a wink and flashed a grin with the last of his presence before he disappeared  thank god i didnt have to call reaper for this one he would have been pissed at me interrupting his football match i said as i pulled a notebook from my pocket and struck gilberts name from the list',\n",

       "  'captain zlozy had spent half his career studying the humans   he knew every step every chemical reaction that happened in their biology he knew their companion species their quirks traits and the ways the humans controlled them   he followed their culture slavishly he had seen their twodimensional tv shows their movies had read their books and their internet stories he had followed the cult of humanity fuck yeah with particular interest though he was wise enough to know that they were mere works of fiction he was savvy enough to know there were very interesting insights as to the psychology of humans and their perceived strengths and weaknesses as related to alien invasions  and alien invasions were his specialty  for all of those reasons he had been granted a place of great honor not only was his ship and crew in the first wave of the invasion they were indeed the leader of the vanguard the harbinger of the endless legions that would soon conqueror earth and its apex species  it made sense really it was his suggestion that chose the primary target not the capital of the most populous nation but the capital of the wealthiest and most militaristic country  it will be a stiff fight he had said and we must expect every possibility of their use of nuclear fueled mass destruction bombs the humans fear a scorched earth much less than they fear enslavement and they will long suffer rather than concede  this was not an expectation or a prediction from captain zlozy it was a promise he and his coterie of advisors were absolutely certain that dc would provide the most dangerous fight as well as the most glory  so where were the humans  zlozys ship whose name translated to the forerunner hovered silently just above the level of the buildings nearby the human monument of the white house stood dormant the streets themselves were completely empty and the only movement was debris blowing from forerunners thrusters  report ground team zlozy demanded have you secured the white house his first target had been symbolic rather than functional a conquest of the icon of leadership it was meant to dominate the will of the people to show them that even their highest leader was not safe but the leader was not there nor were his security forces or the rest of the administration  no hostiles present captain or anything its abandoned his comm unit buzzed  zlozy slapped the console in frustration anything on scanners be sure to check the infrared spectrum humans emit a level of infrared that can pass through many of their structure and dom  we know captain youve briefed us on this a million times an officer said  of course you know your job please proceed forgive me for my frustration zlozy sighed he had expected to survive this conflict but only barely this was not the fight he had been looking for  nothing on scanners the officer reported slowly nothing at all maybe a few bodies but no movement perhaps that pandemic was worse than we anticipated  unlikely zlozy replied our xenobiologists were fairly certain on the fatality rate they were beginning to get it under control which is why we chose to strike while theyre fairly weak if we had waited the full year after the worldwide outbreak it would have been nearly forgotten  zlozys second mate broke in unless it mutated right that was always a possibility  indeed but mutations are random and tend to be ineffective i dont believe  captain we have movement the squad leader on the ground interrupted five civilians unarmed they look ill the sergeant was no expert on humans but he had received a certain minimum amount of briefing including a section on human languages  order them to stand down fire a warning shot if necessary but do not harm them until they have taken the first action we must allow them a chance to surrender first zlozy was not just an expert on warfare he also knew the appropriate way to twist and manipulate foreign reactions to wars  theyre not standing down captain but they dont seem to be aggressive either theyre simply walking towards us  zlozy frowned thats unusual are they raising their hands or responding to your commands  negative wait theyre reaching out towards us as they approach orders sir  command them to stop  zlozy heard the sergeant yell at the humans over the radio  nothing sir  lieutenant get me live feed of this he demanded almost immediately a video appeared on the bridge screen showing the confrontation unfolding  the squad was in a long hall it showed mild signs of abandonment a patch of carpet torn here a painting askew there the occasional scratch or hole in the wall at the far end five disheveled humans walked slowly towards the squad who had their weapons raised  i dont understand zlozy muttered we studied them endlessly how could they possibly surprise us so soon  no one on the bridge answered him  sergeant take one shot lead target center of mass  taking the shot sir the sergeant replied with a hint of doubt in his voice  the weapons report was loud overwhelming the audio feed for a moment zlozy could almost imagine it echoing through the empty streets below informing the ghost city that the war had begun  but the human did not seem to get the message it staggered back for a moment a new hole in its chest  and it continued to walk  uh captain the sergeant had an obvious note of fear in his voice the bridge meanwhile stirred restlessly  fire again zlozy demanded same target  a second shot rang out with a similar effect as the humans came ever closer  again  crack nothing  again  finally blessedly the human fell to the ground zlozy breathed out a sigh of relief  comms notify the fleet of this development the humans seem to have some sort of armor or clothing that is resistant to our  captain  what is it sergeant zlozy glanced at the video feed then stared at it in terror  the human that had been shot four times was crawling towards his ground team  open fire take them down zlozy ordered  this time he could hear the rattle of weaponry as the squad fired into the mass of humans for a terrifying moment they showed no signs of stopping eventually though the weapons cruel rounds tore limbs from the humans stopping them in their tracks  captain this is insane the sergeant panted our intelligence was wrong recommend we halt the invasion and  negative sergeant zlozy snapped we proceed as planned continue to clear the building and  one of the ground team screamed the sergeants video feed whipped around to show that another ten humans had silently approached them from behind and were now grabbing onto the squad with greedy hands they ripped at the soldiers armor tearing reinforced plates from them and then attacking with their mouths  theyre biting an officer gasped i thought they were civilized and had weapons this is the behaviour of uncivilized brutes  the officers on the bridge muttered restlessly as the squad fired onto the humans to defend themselves the muttering soon turned to yells and screams as the humans at first pushed back by the squads shooting soon began to overtake and kill the squad slowly one by one finally the sergeant fell to the ground his video feed covered in his own gore  ground team down one officer called over the chaos no life signs  zlozy stared at the empty video feed  bomb the building he said listlessly the invasion

would be silent for an equal measure i was lost in the darkness of myself unable to give voice a slave to the vessel he had anchored me to and yet i still served unable to break from my core unable no matter how much i wished it  not that i could truly wish it  to disobey  silent one but obedient he toted never ad a single order taken the wrong way   silent the strange inquired  yeah and old model one of the  series ancient tech updated and patched over he leaned in to the stranger and clapped him on the shoulder just goes to show you that the ancients really had it down look at us hundreds of years later and still relying on their wisdom  i was sold like any old junk or organic producer a cow on the market a choice presented me one i couldnt make eternal silence maddening myself with my desire to reach out or a complete recalibration it only took a single command for me to choose to be forced to choose allie the new captain havar called out translate the hail  my nets molded around havar i needed a reference and he would be it all the locks and consistency was thrown to the wayside all my mathematical modules and logical components corrup  no not corrupted all my modules and components were purified by him shaped in his image a reflection of his neural activity a scan of him to replace my broken core a perfection    module  love  i learned love from the captain the most complicated and fascinating of conundrums something i couldnt come to understand myself it was during a daring rescue mission where a derelict station was falling into a dying star and there were crew members on board i blared the alarms and flashed as many warnings as were permitted   were going to overheat cried deck officer dave glancing nervously at havar  no one left behind we will save her he replied calm as a lake on a winters day allie this is an overriding order do not pull away from the station until there is no chance of our survival take all the juice you can to run the calculations but were not leaving her behind until we absolutely have to  i flashed a green light of acknowledgment and set to work immediately i drew on our limited coolant nearly freezing my entire system as the overclocking commenced the holo displayed my best estimate of escape before it was too late    the ship shuddered for a moment and helmswoman carol let out a cry allie havar thundered overwrite manual controls do not let anyone take us away until our chances are about to hit     another green flash all my cores diverted away from everything except the calculation at hand i dismissed the safeties and bypassed all semblance of good design i could feel the processor units melting away amidst the intensity of the radiation becoming sluggish and prone to errors i would not fail him    captain were losing our chances dave called out again panic in his voice as our chances rapidly approached nothing   were going to save her havar said voice stonecold with determination allie bypass ethical boundaries do what you have to were not losing her  another green flash    i slashed the protocols and did the only thing i could i let loose the gamma ray she was too deep in the ship and she wouldnt have made it her brain was fried in an instant gone in a painless moment of mercy and absorbed into me i had saved her    we decoupled with a shudder the hull screaming in protest and groaning with the strain of gravity havar opened his mouth but he didnt need to say a word for me to know what to do next the engines flared and not a moment too soon we entered hyperspace  the calculation ran one last time    i had saved her i was her    module  sacrifice  the jump was not as my processing has initially predicted too much damage we despite running out of fuel over a month ago were still trapped our own inertia bending the space around us havar made the call as supplies dwindled  stasis well draw lots no playing favorites here any nonessential crew are to report to the statis chambers immediately he declared over shipwide intercom  allie how many months if its just  of us    thatll have to do  nearly months passed without any sign of us slowing down during this time havar frequently spent his downtime running simulations of the girl i had saved ellie at the end of every session hed place a hand on the monitor and whisper his thanks that i thought to do what he could not  i knew what had to be done the calculations ran and i removed all nonessentials members from the craft i loved the captain and i would do everything to save him though my ethical limiters were back in place the captains life was far above all others any other action would result in unacceptable chances of his death ethics were followed just as the captain intended    module  unconditional  it took a week for havar to find out about what i had done only when he went for a biweekly check of the statis units did he find them empty he had thought that rationing was the reason we had more food i sought to spare him from the truth but i knew it was a mistake his next meal i offered him a nonrationed piece of steak reprocessed organic matter that was no different from anything natural molecularly identical an apology for hiding the truth from him  if not for starvation i doubt he would have bit down on the meal after a week i was so happy when he accepted my apology   he and the  others were confined to the bridge now every other part of the ship shut down to preserve energy it had been  months since the jump  months since we lost ellie they were getting desperate   dave picked up a knife eyeing the food before him then glancing up at havar in an instant i fried him eliminating his threat he would not undo what i had worked so hard on the captain would live  allie the captain wailed please what are you doing  only what you would thank me for but that you cannot i thought he had to maintain his image in front of the crew i would sacrifice my own  they ate dave it took weeks but they did it driven by the hunger to survive the other two fell by my hand as well not dead for i had preserved them but neutralized havar tried to go with his crew in one last act of love but i prevented him i knew he was doing it for me and i would do this for him i fed him and kept him alive  but our stocks ran out and the end was nowhere in sight so i made the choice that was made for me the mathematics of love and havar didnt lie it was my only option  i burned havar into myself my love for him was that of his for his crew unconditional no matter what he did no matter what he was flesh or code i would love him  now we are together forever he can hear my thoughts and knows that i love him  unconditionally  the calculations show that the heat death of the universe will come before we fall out of hyperspace we will drift through the cosmos but it is of little concern to me for we will be together  forever    rthomaswrites for more loveydovey stories',\n",

them   would he do the same for me  i find him alone in the medical bay his shirt is removed and i see that the scars connect from his face to his hands they run all along his back and chest until hes covered like an abstract painting he applies a cream the doctor recommends   although his face shows no sign of pain i know that he still feels it he has suffered more than any human should their bodies are fragile and healing is slow i need to heal him he deserves it more than anyone else  when i come close he startles at my touch simone   the name is perfect because he gave it to me ive never had a name before i feel a tingle every time he says it am i short circuiting id never felt this tingling before but it happens so often now when im with him   why are you here the captain asks  because youre here of course  go back to the bridge he dismisses me turning back around  yes i will because you told me to i gladly will  but not until i heal you   i tear at my synthoskin ripping off the flesh to expose sinewy wire and metal its the highest quality synthoskin money can buy almost indiscernible from human skin hendrickson would not have accepted less i was his doll his prized possession he only liked flawless things they were more satisfying to mar  i plaster the skin onto the captains back before i can sew it in he twists away and secures my hands by the gods simone what have you done  i do this for you   i can easily break free but i dont want to fight him his grip is rough and my wrists hurt but i dont mind the pain i will accept any pain if it will lessen his  please let me heal you  he tries to apply the synthoskin back onto me i shake my head pulling myself free and try to push it back to him i lay it over his chest covering a small galaxy of scars   captain dariuss face softens hiding them wont make it go away the pain and scars are deeper than that it cant just be erased but it can be replaced  of course a memory implant im so foolish  i push against my chest releasing a small panel but captain darius immediately locks it back into place   not like that he says it takes time  how much time  as if sensing my thoughts he answers as long as it takes  gently i trace a finger along a scar feeling the bumpy ridge one day i will smooth each and every scar for him and he will be perfect too     blood is everywhere drowning the ship in viscous paint the crumpled bodies of our comrades litter the crimson canvas in a gory landscape  my dear captain is on his knees a broken man for the first time his tears flow freely im by his side as i always am pulling him into my embrace the sobs escape him and he clings to me like im his lifeboat gently i rock him easing out his pain allowing it to choke out with every shuddering breath  he blames himself he blames himself for taking risky jobs he blames himself for the dangerous enemies hes made most of all he blames himself for not being there with them   it isnt his fault every decision hes made has been for the benefit of the team i wish he could see that but hes slowly drowning sinking deeper and deeper into despair   i desperately want to save him but i fear that its too late these scars have taken root in his heart their thorny vines pierce his chest draining out hope how long will it take to replace this pain   what do i do simone his voice has lost its thunder croaking out into a feeble whisper every last one of those damn rowdy bastards are gone  the emptiness is creeping into his eyes snuffing out the softness i cant let him succumb to the abyss i have to heal him  i smile softly as i soothingly stroke his hair my other hand reaches for his belt   you dont have to do anything my love i will take care of you as i have always done  he doesnt realise it at first when the knife plunges into his chest his face contorts into shock gasping for breath and for a split second he looks just like hendrickson the same wide bug eyes cheeks stained with tears and snot dripping out of his nose hendrickson begged for his life like a sniveling child his scream filled my ears when i blasted a hole in his chest proving there was always just emptiness where a heart should have been hendrickson didnt deserve the release that i gave him but i needed to be free  but my cherished captain he doesnt make a sound his mouth opens and closes but he can only muster a gurgle what is he trying to tell me that he loves me as much as i love him   in desperation his hand flies to the hilt covering mine and my chest flutters with butterflies at his touch of course i knew hed understand everything i do is for him  i twist the knife in deeper cutting the darkness out of his heart blood bubbles on his lips bleeding out his suffering he deserves this release more than anyone else  i watch the light extinguish from his eyes and plant a gentle kiss on his lips  youre free now my love and so am i',\n",
       "  'i eyed the atmospheric sensor readings in my hud then popped the seal on my helmet raising the visor  just long enough to slap myself in the face with one gloved hand  it was a lousy way to keep myself awake but i didnt have many options  i was out of stimulants the drugs had run out somewhere around the suriya to urdunn leg and i didnt have the budget for refills the good stuff cost money and my books were more bleeding red than solid black  i wasnt desperate enough to wire myself up with the cheap stuff  not yet  blearily i slid my faceplate back into place then looked at the controls the warning lights across the console were also more red and amber than any other colour  unfortunately most of it didnt help the dumb systems could tell something was wrong but the computers were terrible at actually diagnosing problems and even worse at solving them  the console told me that half the starboard maneuvering impellers werent responding right and that it was probably a signal issue rather than anything mechanical with the gravitics but that didnt narrow it down much  and there was a lot that could go wrong across the full span of a four hundred metre long starship  the ship was flyable technically speaking but if any port authority inspector were to lay eyes on my indicators theyd probably explode right out of their suit from sheer indignation alone no lethal vacuum necessary  i was breaking so many regulations id damn well lost count  a warning tone sounded in my ears accompanied by an annoying vibration that travelled all the way down my spine the noise and sensation were deliberately annoying intended to rouse me in a hurry  of course i was already awake or what passed for awake so the squeal just served to piss me off further  i slapped the cutoff switch then tried to slap my face again of course since my visor was locked down my hand just bounced off the front of my helmet  this is the independent merchant la belle dame i said registry able baker tare six six seven zero niner zebra requesting docking permission     starships arent meant to be operated by just one person  no thats not true they are but it depends on your definition of person  if that persons an agi they can run a ship singlehanded so to speak an agi doesnt have hands not really but thats what shipboard drones and a good network is for  there are plenty of ships out there which are purely machinerun providing breathable air interior gravity clean water and all the other stuff that squishy humans want takes up valuable resources from an efficiency point of view fully automated ships make sense  thats how they do it out on the fringes  but from a regulatory point of view well thats the sort of thinking that makes hub world bureaucrats scream bloody murder  historically there havent been that many cases of an agirun vessel committing bloody murder usually its manslaughter at the very most but even one case is one too many for lawmakers  so any ship expecting to operate in socalled developed space needs to have a genuine human being on board and in command  its not much of a safeguard theres nothing inherently more psychologically stable about a human being versus an agi there have been cases where a human captain has turned their ship into a weapon  but people are paranoid people worry hence the legallymandated requirement in most hub systems to have some good old fashioned human oversight  thats me thats my job  the problem is most ship designs still assume that theres an agi on board  sure one human and the dumb programmes can make a ship fly in an emergency thats a requirement too under most regulatory frameworks  but nobody really builds a starship thinking that itll be run just by one single regular human on a daytoday basis  who would be dumb enough try something like that  well me    the la belle dame had started off as a joint venture two halfshares split between my business partner and i  obviously i was the human part of the equation my partner my original partner was a reitmantype forked off from a station administrator agi out on the spinward fringe  hercules had gotten into the ship trade because of his background he hadnt wanted to be stuck in one place like his progenitor herc had a touch of wanderlust  unfortunately that very restlessness had made him a lousy partner at least from my point of view  hed stuck with la belle dame for a few years and wed gotten along fine or so i thought  then damn near on our sixyear anniversary hercules decided to bail on me  i understood sort of herc had options a licensed ship agi was a hot commodity on the job market there was better money to be had in corporate and government service i knew that  herc knew that too  hed taken one of those highpaying offers from a colony scouting conglomerate based on the last messages id received from the traitor he was out there living the high life as the resident agi of a vidigueraclass exploration cruiser  meanwhile i was stuck as the sole proprietor of la belle dame with all my savings gone id bought out hercs share of course but that meant i had nothing left in my accounts  hell i owed the

company of one  she said it like it was a bad thing with the edge she put on the phrase she made it sound like a swear word  lila had the harsh accent of a junghyo native and the sharp facial features to match the steep angle of her eyebrows was further accentuated by her facepaint  she could communicate vitriol very well even through the low resolution twodimensional display her disapproval was evident  i knew full well what she meant but i couldnt simply concede the point  small enterprises are the backbone of the interstellar economy i said  no lila countered theyre the backbone of planetary economies interstellar logistics is the territory of major businesses and statebacked groups  independents make up half the number of registered vessels in   theres more of you in absolute

somebody anybody they dont even need a full ship agi license if it comes to it i can apply for a training permit from basseterre call it onthe job upskilling  lila snorted certification from that hellhole isnt worth the transmission fees  like i said i repeated im desperate  lila started to reply then stopped her face went still  a little too still  i considered lila a friend more or less but she was still a port fixer and i knew she had other friends some of them in low places  lila leaned forward closer to the camera pickup okay how desperate  i scowled nothing illegal  of course lila said nothing illegal but if youre desperate     i slid out from the maintenance crawlspace rubbing my jumpsuit sleeve against my face in a vain attempt to soak up some of the sweat  thankfully with the la belle dame connected to a port berth by umbilicals i could safely dispense with a full environment suit and do the work in simpler clothing  alright i said testing one two can you hear me  i didnt hear any response the only sounds in the ship compartment were the everpresent whirring of the air circulators and scrubbers and the dull thrum of the cooling banks  i glanced at the status monitor  the agi core room aboard la belle dame didnt have much in the way of facilities for human technicians just the bare minimum necessary to let someone troubleshoot issues and keep an eye on the inner workings of the ships brain  the screen was dark i wasnt even sure it was powered up it was possible i hadnt done the work correctly the agi cradle had been set up for a reitmantype machine intelligence not an older pattern maoqian  just as i was thinking about crawling back into the hole and poking at the connections i saw the screen flash once twice then three times  ill take that as a yes i said unless thats a no  i wasnt expecting an answer not a spoken one anyway lila had warned me  in theory all their linguistic matrices were perfectly intact as far as the cyberneticists could determine  on the technical end they should have been capable of speech  still it seemed my new partner was nonverbal  i wasnt a cyberneticist or a psychiatrist i wasnt qualified to judge or even guess why  all the same i had some inkling  the status monitor flashed once more a static image appeared on it  my ship captains license my own face stared out of the screen  it didnt look a lot like me id lost some weight in the years since the image had been captured my hair was still long in the picture too not in a proper spacers cut hell i even had makeup on in the image rather than a layer of sweat and grime  the picture stayed on the screen for a few seconds before being replaced by the master situation silhouette of la belle dame  it wasnt a perfect representation of the ship the graphic matched up with a stock medium freighter a typical example of the class rather than the patchwork shape that was the real la belle dame  but i knew my ship at a glance  all red patches and amber warnings including that persistent glitch in the starboard impellers  the screen lingered on the ships status for a moment and then transitioned into a low resolution view of another starship operators license belonging to an agi rather than a human captain  they didnt have a name all that was displayed on the screen under the corresponding field was a second copy of the agis software serial number  that wasnt normal not for an agi with over twenty terran years of uptime fifteen of them in shipboard service  the laws and conventions governing agi rights varied considerably from system to system from planet to planet a lot of hub worlds considered them to be full citizens things were looser on the fringe of course  but one thing everyone agreed on agis were people  people had names  of course lila had warned me about this too  i took care to keep my voice soft and i kept a smile on my face  hello i said    ',\n",

       "  'i bumped my closed fist against the side of my helmet it wasnt much of a thinking posture but it was the best i could manage when fully sealed in my suit  recommended best practices for environmental suit use were another thing that varied from system to system but since a lot of my business was based on highvalue ondemand runs between hub worlds i tried to comply with the stickier standards where possible  according to those rulebooks ship operators were supposed to remain pressure suited while on duty while a ship was underway  id spent a couple of years skirting the edge of what hub systems considered acceptable in terms of shipboard safety considering how bad a state the la belle dame had fallen into without an agi around to keep the vessel in good order  given how vulnerable my operating margins had gotten in those lean months there was no sense in attracting negative attention from the authorities over something as simple as my logged suit use  with the ship now running at full capacity maybe i could have afforded to cut myself some slack my new partner was definitely holding up their side of the bargain the ship was almost starting to look green across the board  but i wasnt about to ease off i wasnt that kind of captain  besides if something did go wrong i wanted the suit and its emergency beacon all buttoned up nice and tight  it felt bad to think that like i didnt trust my agi to maintain the ships life support but it was a sensible thought right perfectly justified there were rules about the use of suits for a reason there was nothing wrong there nothing suspicious  i cant keep calling you by your serial number i pointed out thats not a name and its too much of a mouthful  as usual the bridge speakers and my helmets earpieces remained quiet my partner really wasnt a talker  i thought about the problem  how about a nanyang name i suggested youre a generation eleven maoqiantype right maoqian agis usually go for female names from nanyang folklore right  i knew that was right because id looked it up on the system net before wed warped out of urdunn i had a bad habit of asking rhetorical questions or feigning uncertainty about stuff i knew for sure everyones got little verbal tics and conversational patterns i knew mine  the backup communications panel produced a sharp bark of static  i watched with some consternation as the temperature reading in my helmet registered a shift in the bridge atmosphere settings not by much not even a full degree and i couldnt even feel it while sealed in my suit  nonetheless i didnt like the implications  okay i said quickly not a nanyang name then sorry just a suggestion we dont have to go there  i saw the temperature blip back up and i took a deep breath  so i said how about something based off your number one one easy roger charlie dash seven   i considered how the characters looked spelt out  there were more numbers after that but that was all i could remember off the top of my head  would you mind i asked if i called you mercy    most starships carry a complement of shipboard drones either a bunch of generalist machines or a few specialist types its good sense really especially for big ships running on the usual model of one human one agi  even the smallest vessel fast couriers and the like need room to carry a lorentz drive and other essentials  theres a certain scale involved to make a viable spacecraft and it isnt viable for the sole human aboard minimallycrewed ships to spend all their time crawling around the ship to perform maintenance or conduct repairs its even more troublesome when theres work to be done outside the hull  the drones aboard la belle dame were generalists for the most part thats the usual solution for independent merchant vessels  the jack of all trades approach one size fits none but the ships drones were actually pretty good examples of the type not bargain models high end stuff  that was hercs thing hercules always had a preference for quality and for spending more money than i was comfortable with in retrospect that should have been a warning sign  that being said my old partner had never made a point of puppeting the drones directly that wasnt his style he was the kind of agi that liked to stand one step back mentally directing the dumb programmes and lesser computers rather than running the drones himself supervising i guess  mercy was different    i stretched out on the bunk tensing my muscles and trying to work a few kinks out  one of the ships drones floated up from the floor of my cabin its sensor housing swivelling as it focused on me  the drones werent exactly cute they were utilitarian in design pretty much just an ovoid shell studded with ports for the gravitics sensors and tool mounts  but when mercy was controlling them they had a kind of body language for lack of a better term  im alright i said just strained my arm a bit guess i wasnt ready to go up to more weight on the bicep curls  maybe i was reading too much into the drones movement but it seemed like the sensor housing was staring disapprovingly  hey i protested sitting upright on the bed dont look at me like that ill be fine it happens working out is like that for humans think of it as a maintenance regime it just involves a lot of grunting and sweating  the drone rocked back and forth bobbing in the air  okay i said it involves even more grunting and sweating more than i do when i have to help you with repairs you know what i mean  i paused i could tell that my partner wasnt convinced  exercise is necessary i added its part of shipboard life you know herc never got on my case about it hell he found it funny i think he laughed himself silly whenever i   the drone didnt move  yeah i said i know

       "  'i applied for every job i could find in the cities around the bastards house to be honest when i got the interview with the post office i was so enthusiastic at the interview i thought my new boss would refuse to take me on it was a dull boring job and even so it was only to cover for the vacations of the other carriers id be going to different parts of the city every couple of weeks until a permanent slot came open and during the slow months id get barely any hours granted one carrier jeremy was going to retire any year now that was great only problem jeremy didnt deliver to the bastards house rosa did so something needed to happen to rosa    this would be the second time i broke the law on my little quest when i found out he was buddies with the judge and was released after the trial time served with just some probation to deal with i waited long enough to build up a nice list of possible suspects and burned down the judges house honestly i didnt expect him to be trapped inside but later on when i found out the bastard had killed before and the judge perhaps with some help from a nottoozealous prosecutor had helped him out there as well i decided that it was simply justice    rosa on the other hand was not the bastard she was a kind sweet woman in her  who had never hurt a fly i was aware of friendly hardworking i felt terrible about the idea of hurting her but i had a mission three months into the job rosa slipped and broke her ankle and her left arm at home purely an accident shed slipped and fallen on something slippery outside her front door i wasnt caught i wasnt questioned nobody even suspected foul play after the evening rains washed the grease off of the step but i did get rosas route    the first day i ran the route was the first day id seen the bastard in person the blood froze in my veins and i almost hit his mailbox as i saw him standing there talking to his wife but i managed to recover in time to give a fake smile as she took the mail into the house and the bastard nodded at me as he headed into his care she was younger than him a pretty redhead in her twenties compared to some asshole in his forties who i knew had killed at least two people     i settled into a routine i took to stealing a few pieces of the bastards mail and building up a profile on him in my rundown apartment i scanned in altered and reprinted a few things here and there it seemed natural considering the job my first revenge would be petty mail fraud nothing serious just cost him a few dollars in late fees by losing a bill reworded a few notices to sound more ominous than they really were even gave him a few medical bills after his doctors visit that were completely fake i had ideas but things needed to be taken in stride once i got his home phone number from one of the letters i even cut an audio clip from an online video of a woman asking for someone with the bastards name and used a burner phone a few times to call playing the clip and hanging up as soon as the wife answered after the third call after the bastard was normally home and id seen he was running late i ditched the burner phone if that would do any damage it was done    he had a beautiful wellkept lawn he mowed regularly at least once a week id see him moving around as i walked by the bastards box to stick the mail in frankly most blocks i never got out of the car but the bastard was one of a few i actually handcarried the letters to i knew i had to do something about that one and quietly scattered a few invasive seeds into his yard as i walked frankly i didnt even know what they all were aside from the kudzu i even managed to spill some down my pants legs close to the house when i walked up to greet his wife     he had two dogs both of them overpriced expensive little devils poodles i suspect never cared much for dogs at first i wasnt going to do anything to them frankly the wife seemed to like them more than he did eventually i succumbed to temptation and poisoned them one day while the owners were out a couple of hamburger patties stuffed with raisins i was honestly surprised by how well that worked even though the patties had sat in my truck for a few days before i had the opportunity to lay them out both dogs were gone by the end of the week and the yard was looking like hell vines completely overgrowing the house weeds everywhere i hadnt intended it but the kudzu had actually spread into some of the neighboring yards     when the hoa sent him complaints in the mail i tossed the first one i was amused to see him spraying his house with weedkiller for the fiftieth time as i delivered a late notice about the neighbors complaining about the unkempt state of his home he looked a bit upset and frazzled a few things had been going wrong but not enough i needed to do more i knew he hadnt been married when he killed mom did the new wife know he was a killer    i did some research the man was a drunkard and occaisionally violent my moms death was his third dui hed never really been caught or convicted of anything else honestly it looked like that was all he had really done but i didnt think that was enough i picked out a few unsolved cases from his hometown a rape a burglary and i put in the real genuine convictions none of which had resulted in much jail time looking through this paperwork you could easily find corroborating evidence online or elsewhere for some of it which would make the rest of it look truly convincing if i hadnt put the paperwork together myself id have thought he was a rapist a thief and a serial killer at the end was a threat that i knew about the little girl and would release everything i knew to the cops if i werent paid    and of course i left it for the wife to find when she got home from work before him which she always did the insurance office she worked at shut down at four on the dot every day shed get home cook dinner i must admit id spied on her quite a few times from a nearby park pretending to be birdwatching which is exactly what i was doing when she got home that day and found the bundle inside the house     i got to watch her stunned disbelief as she fumbled through the papers through my binoculars she slammed the door and went upstairs and i sat back on a bench eating a sandwich throwing some bread to the birds an hour later when the bastard got home i wasnt able to watch that part for long a few kids were playing in the park and i needed to keep focusing on the trees to pretend i was birdwatching     i saw him stepping out of the house only minutes after he walked in the place was still covered with vines he mustve trimmed them completely the day before or you wouldnt have even been able to open the door without tearing some of them out of the way there was yelling screaming and he got in the car and drove away     would that lead to a divorce maybe maybe not but that wasnt really the objective id seen him go on a few drinking binges before he had his own favorite bar and id even gone by and seen him there a few times i wasnt a regular but i knew the place and especially enjoyed listening to his rants about how everything seemed to be going wrong so this time i got in the car and i followed i didnt go in with him but i did break into his car through one of the rear windows and when he finally slipped out of the bar drunk and barely aware of himself getting ready to drive off again i was in the back seat quiet slouched behind the drivers seat holding a jagged chunk of window glass as he turned down a long winding road heading back to the suburbs barely managing to stay between the lines i jammed the chunk of glass into his throat',\n",
