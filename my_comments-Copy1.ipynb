I'm following Alice's NLP tutorial and I like the succinct way she wrote a reusable piece of code to put all comments in a dictionary as values, with the subreddit name as the key, then turning each subreddit's list of comments into a single giant string. However, when I try to stem/lemmatize these huge strings after cleaning them, the computer reaches its recursive limit. So I may need to go back and enter each corpus in manually (as I do a bit further below), then clean and lemmatize before creating the large strings. \n",

Psychology has the next highest at 21, indicating lively discussion around topics. From there, words per comment drops to 14 for worldnews - people probably give relatively short replies based on their thoughts about current events. Politics at 13 is the same type of thing.\n",
