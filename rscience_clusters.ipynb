papers     hematopoietic stem cell hsc function decreases with age a process that likely contributes to the weakened adaptive immune response characteristic of older individuals chen et al found that hscs from old mice showed increased activation of mammalian target of rapamycin mtor signaling compared to those from young mice intriguingly inhibition of mtor with the drug rapamycin reversed agingrelated declines in mouse hsc function and enhanced the ability of old mice to mount an effective immune response to infection with influenza virus the authors thus propose that manipulation of

published in science immunologists call for strategies to address  using therapeutics that target aging   aging is associated with increased morbidity arising from a range of tissue dysfunctions a common denominator of ageassociated frailty is increased baseline inflammation called inflammaging that is present in older individuals recent studies have shown that the presence of excessive inflammation can inhibit immunity in both animals and humans and that this can be prevented by blocking inflammatory processes this finding has important implications for the immunity of older

       " 'first off its fantastic you are doing this thank you  nbsp  my question  what tangible and real things are you doing to fix this  nbsp  background i dedicated  years of my life to building an engineering program for underrepresented and underserved people in stem and tech  i had a phenomenal team of other volunteers who helped but they stayed  quarters before moving on typical turnover rate a handful stuck around and were hired  a core part of the curriculum was the intangible skills such as persistence resilience curiosity grit opportunity identification and others these were taught through mentorship and a carefully crafted program that hid them under the surface of hardware engineering design and entrepreneurship   i forwent pay for those two years so that we could put more money into the program and because i wasnt doing it for money i was doing it because i hope to send off generations of global leaders in tech and business individuals who embody and perpetuate the ideal dream that we are all reaching for  nbsp  why i ask the question that i ask  i did not start volunteering at the nonprofit to save people i did it because i knew and grew up around east palo alto from the  and i always like to expand peoples worlds so many people i hung out with from there never saw stem or the high tech jobs that were right next door as an option it just didnt exist in their world also i did it because i was fortunate to be raised by parents who raised me in a multicultural community where there was never a question of diversity and inclusiveness it just was my first experiences with the fact that the world didnt run that way was when i stepped out of that community and it made me sad to see and determined to push us towards that ideal  im particularly good at the full stack of engineering leading and building when the admin team at the nonprofit saw how i worked and was able to do every aspect of what we were doing they asked me to build the engineering program as i saw fit i was super stoked  it was immediately a wild success and from  over  students came through the doors of that program alone and many volunteers from google facebook linkedin apple and even the military rd teams  nbsp  but  i saw so many more people come and join and immediately assume an administrator role they were too good to clean up or take out the trash they rapidly rose to a role that didnt require them helping people directly and instead allowed them to delegate or do outreach things that you do need a handful of people doing but not so many  to me it seemed like it may have unconsciously become a nice accolade or resume item but not so much an opportunity to truly and profoundly impact each and every life that came through that door  ive seen this many other places as well  nbsp  to me the students ages  see the way we act and interact with our environment and when they see that we have ownership of our building engineering design lab equipment when they see that we put in countless hours to keep things clean and nice and such that the students get the best experience every single day it communicates to them in profound and deep ways when we dont have that ownership they respond to that  it has always been a mantra of mine we leave the place as good if not better than when we got here my students learned that and would be given time to clean up and reorganize after a night of classes the other tracks in the program didnt do this their volunteers didnt do it and it came clear through how people felt about each respective track to me the leaders need to be willing to sweep up too   look no further than doug jones and joe reed for examples of people who were too high and mighty to clean the toilets or take out the trash those come from prior interviews by gimlet medias reply all team  nbsp   my wife is latin native american and caucasian i am a mixed mutt despite not looking like it  one of the first things she told me was that it was the mentors that she worked beside and who encouraged her who truly and profoundly impacted her life who were the ones who put the idea that she could go into a stem field into her head and ultimately lead her to drive towards a phd and get it  nbsp  in the midst of our personal and professional pursuits her and i have voluntarily and proactively done outreach events ranging from demonstrations to presentations that have gone incredibly well and touched communities who dont typically get attention from people from scientific engineering and entrepreneurial backgrounds  we both feel that its imperative to have the people promoting diversity and inclusiveness in stem also acting to make it a reality and not just being a figurehead thats good at getting attention although that helps  you can imagine my personal frustration at how many who are good at getting media attention arent actually spending the time on the front line making it a reality again dont get me wrong those people are a crucial component but what do those childrentoadults think when they see a figure head who isnt the one doing the work what message does that send  nbsp  three last items for clarity   the communities i was working with simply needed encouragement and the door to be open to them they are super smart innovative and talented and the local companies like facebook google etc really need to genuinely help them get their foot in the door these people are shining stars that simply need the platform to show what they are capable of   i am ignorant of who you are beyond the information that

say this question comes from a place of love even though i provided some background and frustrations  thank you for answering if you get to this   oh and one answer to my question is this reddit
